Sx8TMOWLNuJBWer-0pcmoA,4,"Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",DK-hGw3XSTJHT26yjzeG3Q,4,"Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today.

Still don't like the sandwiches. Tried the fries though and tasty!"
VE11x_UNVxri3ZHTzcG2jw,5,"We went around 6 and it was more packed than I expected. I knew it would be busy but I was surprised. The staff was amazing. We waited in line for about 8 minutes regardless of it being a huge line going out side. Found a table and had our food in less than five minutes. Even with the amount of people they had, it ran so smoothly. One sandwich was messed up but it was very loud in there so I don't think she heard me correctly but someone came to our table and had a new correct sandwich almost immediately. I love that they made time to go around asking if we needed refills and how the food was. So glad to have a chick fil a in Reno. They upheld the chick fil a standards even with all the chaos of opening day.",zkdQne-z9Eho56o0l18SeQ,5,"We went around 6 and it was more packed than I expected.

This service is still as wonderful as opening day! Coming to your restaurant is always an incredible experience. I would point out a specific employee to praise but honestly every employee is so amazing!"

Zb_27vX8weaYyDn-_2ZhVA,1,"This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.",-crxsnaKPE07GLVPvX0MMQ,1,"This is an updated review.

I got a cluster or roses on my shoulder with some ""brush strokes"" of color on them. My tattoo artist is Eddie. He is very friendly and fun! He did exactly like I asked. He is a very good artist. His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here.

Gotta be able to do an extremely straight line. Good line work is the mark of a good tattoo artist. Santana is an awesome artist and very friendly. You gotta see his portfolio!

Update: After I posted this review the manager contacted me and apologized. They offered me to come back again and have it done properly. I did and I am very happy with the service and result. It was night and day from last time so I guess it really depends on who does the service for you. My only complaint is that the nail dryer could be more powerful so it doesn't dry nails as effectively as it could. However this doesn't have to do with the service I received from my students who was awesome. Very attentive and professional. I will be going back again because they did reach out and made up for the initial mistake."

It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",8rc_chEA-0hepb_WQea7jg,4,"UPDATE: Roberto, the owner reached out to me and showed true care and compassion for his business and customers. We had multiple discussions back and forth and I could tell he wanted to make my poor experience better and because of this, I told him I would give them another chance. I went in this morning and was greeted by a very nice gentleman behind the counter and then given some additional information about my order that I was unaware of by the barista, which was greatly appreciated. My order was also made quickly, even with me waiting behind another customer. My drink still wasn't very hot but definitely an improvement from this past weekend. I am happy to re-rate The Blind Tiger. Thank you Roberto! We should have more local businesses show this much care.

Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. 

Actually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. 

The food is passable, but unexceptional.

EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!!
So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me ..
Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note...
Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again .... 
We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!!
This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!!
WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex..
Ohhh , they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!!
You're just a number , you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!!"

The downfall to the constant food production is that sometimes they make so much, a burger may sit around and get luke warm. I did just have a cool temp burger and nuggets, however when i brought it the their attention, they immediately made sure i got fresh 'hot and juicy' food. Not a big deal but does need patience. 
Since i ate inside it was not that big a deal, if i went to the drive through and then hopped on the Turnpike before i took a bite, i would be very upset.

FE-M_ecciOUiWxEePTa1ew,1,"Usually I wait at least 2 weeks to write a hair review however I can tell that a great job was done already. I have a background in cosmetology so I already know how to do hair, but for lazy purposes I like to go to a salon for my own head. I came on a walk in day and was in and out which I liked. The salon was clean and the staff was pretty friendly. A stylist named Erica did my sew in and girl named Chante did my braids. Both lady's did a great job. I really liked that Erica did not leave too much space in between my tracks which some salons tend to do. She also paid a lot of attention to my leave out. Instead of giving my leave out a basic flat iron on top, she took her time and blended it right. You can tell she cares about her work. Will recommend to my friends and will most likely revisit. 4 stars since they charge $20 more for each bundle added after 2. Don't get me wrong I'm not cheap but 3 bundles is equivalent to 2 packs of beauty supply hair if you think about it so thats one charge I didn't quite understand. Nonetheless still a decent sew in for under a $100. 


Now for an updated review: If you don't care about being in an unfriendly and unprofessional environment, this would be the perfect salon for you. Yes, it is a cheap & affordable alternative than going to other high end salons in the area BUT this place is not what it used to be. I loved this salon before but I'm not sure if the management changed or the stylists just stopped giving a rats ass. For one, when you walk in the salon YOU DON'T feel the least bit welcomed. The receptionist is beyond ratchet. Like BEYOND! From gossiping to outright falling asleep at the desk. Yes, falling asleep! For two, none of the good stylists with the exception of one named Carl even works here anymore. I wish that I could post pictures of how bad my hair came out but since I started taking it out as soon as I hopped in my car I can't. $100.00 down the drain. The stylist who did my hair was named Brandy. Brandy took THREE HOURS to do a sew in. A bad one at that. My braids were loose and bumpy. The tracks were spread so far apart! She had a nice attitude but the poor baby just didn't know what she was doing. She said that she went to beauty school but the only thing she did good was cut my bang. The rest looked absolutely horrible. She told me she had only been there for two weeks and that should have been que to get up. If you need a cheap sew in go here, but if you have the money do yourself a favor and go somewhere that's gonna do quality work.",24YtV970liaPKZKaKDfvuQ,4,"Usually I wait at least 2 weeks to write a hair review however I can tell that a great job was done already.

I received a call From Kevin the manager of Fixit and he reviewed the repair ticket which showed I had asked for them not to reassemble my I pad. He asked me to bring it in so they could make things right. So they disassembled it at no charge as I waited. 

Kevin is an exception these days because he really cares about customer service and makes things right."

Update 7/27:  I wish I could give them less than one star.  I called the vendor myself today, and was told no one from Menard's ever contacted them.   The vendor said it was Menard's responsibility as the seller to follow up on this order, and the customer should not have to deal with this.

Update:  After sending an email to Customer Service, I finally got a response.  

""Thank you for your email.  I am very sorry for your recent experience with the St. Ann Menards store! I have sent a cancellation request to our vendor for your order.   As soon as I have more information, I would be happy to contact you back.  In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions.""

I will let you know how long it will take until they ""have more information"" and when I get a refund. Since, Menards has No Credibility, I will be following up with the Vendor."

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

8elcvgZ_HoXoKUbzTla1Gw,4,"Khyber was a great find for a trip to Philly. My girlfriend and I stumbled upon it when we were looking for a place to eat. I would definitely come back here.

The pub:
The area is sectioned into a bar area and a seating area. The bar was completely full when we came in and there were two decent sized groups in the seating area. The noise level was loud but we were able to still talk to each other if we leaned in and talked a bit louder. The lights are dimmed down but there are candles on the table that give a very warm atmosphere. The decor was very ""pub like"" and there were nice wooden benches to sit on for tables. 

The food:
+Bacon Grease Popcorn
We seen so many reviews recommending the popcorn so we had to try it. There's a reason for the hype. The popcorn was incredible. It had such an intense flavor from the bacon grease that it felt like if you ate the bag of popcorn, you would be satisfied with that as a meal. At the same time, I wasn't able to eat this popcorn like I would other popcorn or chips. My hand kept plunging in for more but at a certain point, I just couldn't anymore. It wasn't that I was full, it was that I think the flavor was almost too much for me to have it all in one go. This wasn't a big deal however. We took the popcorn home to eat and we managed to eat it over several days. The popcorn didn't show signs of becoming stale until the fourth day in and it was just left out, wrapped in a plastic bag. The popcorn comes in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down so that you get maybe 3/4 of a standard brown bag. When its brought out, dots of oil will already begin to show on the brown bag, almost as if it were a signature mark to an amazing snack. I would highly recommend getting this cheap and amazing appetizer and would definitely get this if I were to come back. 

+Roast Duck Sandwich
The roast duck was pretty good but I didn't eat much of it. It was my girlfriend's meal. It was a special that day and I think it was well worth it but I wouldn't get it again if we came back.

+Pulled Pork
I never had pulled pork before so I thought it was a bit dry. However, the sauces they provide you with go above and beyond to make this meal amazing. The three sauces are either vinegar based, mustard based, or ketchup based. My preference was the mustard then the ketchup and leagues behind is the vinegar for the simple fact that the vinegar was just a liquid and I like my sauces thicker. I realized I am not a huge fan of pulled pork however, and would not get this again.

The duck and pork came with sides:
+Cheddar Cheese Fries
The fries were pretty good but nothing special about them in my opinion. The cheddar cheese was nice but it wasn't too different from other cheese fries I've had. 

+Mashed Potatoes
These mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had. They aren't those pureed potatoes that you get from Boston Market or KFC. They were mashed enough so that they had a consistent... consistency but they were as liquidy as pureed mash. They had the skins on them still which I am a huge fan for and they were seasoned very well. The right amount. I would get these again.

+Baked Mac n Cheese
This was the best part of the meal, second to the popcorn. There wasn't anything too special about this mac n cheese and yet it was so delicious. The breading was just the right amount, maybe a bit less than I would have liked and the cheese was so very creamy. I would definitely come back for more. 

This was a nice place and I could definitely see people coming here with a bunch of their friends, getting some drinks and getting the amazing bacon grease popcorn to share. For a couples place, I think it was too loud but we definitely enjoyed it for a date. Just as long as it isn't too busy.",mbjXq0gNv4oHSCEideqzxQ,5,"Khyber was a great find for a trip to Philly.

I questioned why they were harassing me and they threw me on the ground, improperly handcuffed me (which is illegal),screamed at me, called me a ""fat mother f'er"" ""Bitch"" ""that's what you get"" among other obscenities, and proceeded to call the pinellas county sheriffs department.

Go to Blues City. Just go. Don't be afraid of the lines. It moves quickly and is usually the sign of a worthy establishment. Also don't be afraid if you are standing in line and a firetruck, St. Louis PD swat and multiple EMT's show up. Chances are no one is in trouble, they are there to eat. 

New favorites: The Big Tommy, Chicken Shack Ranch, and basically any special on the board. Also the chocolate chip cookies have that wonderful crispy edge gooey center thing going on. 

In summary: Go to Blues City. Stand awkwardly next to people while you all wait in line. Eat all the things. Repeat weekly.

I somehow managed to avoid the crazy lunch time crowd everyone warns against. Maybe Mondays at 11:15 is the secret down time? Even though the restaurant was full there was no line and I was in and out with my lunch in less than ten minutes. Great service and friendly waitstaff. 

I ordered the Chicken Shack Ranch because I feel like bacon, cheese and ranch are where a person should always start. Man it was good. Like so good I have already planned to come back and order it again the following day good. I've also started a list of other sandwiches I want to try. No doubt each sandwich will be better than the next. Anyone want to come with me? I feel like this should be a group effort.

My scrambled eggs were perfect, light and fluffy. The bone fries were crisp on the outside, silky on the inside. The portions were huge-- I took most of the potatoes and half the excellent biscuit home for a future meal. Service was friendly, if a bit disorganized. I'd take off half a point if I could on the beverage side. The orange juice purported to be fresh squeezed but tasted like it came from concentrate.

Edit: came back again the next day and did the Thai shrimp poboy and it was excellent. Plenty of shrimp, Great flavor on the Cole slaw and chili sauce to give it some kick. Bread was good too. 

Also did a blue chick smoothie. Nice that it had real fruit instead of a mix. More of a slushee though since there didn't seem to be any cream in it. It was okay, but overpriced."

by31hbnLgOI8wIFA8HB1Yg,5,I have eaten at just about every decent Indian restaurant in Philly and was not sure what to expect from sher-e-Punjab in media.  To my pleasant surprise the food is outstanding.  The samosas are on point as well as the nan bread.   The soups are tasty as well.  Absolutely love their Marsala dishes and what really make them are the quality of meat they use.  The chicken and lamb are high quality not that fatty stuff....which cannot be said at many Indian restaurants.   The tandoor is nicely spiced and really I haven't had a dish I didn't like there.  Have dined in and take out...both are great but obviously Indian is best served piping hot so sit in if you can.  Not to mention its byob so what more do you want?

rvVHGIfukq2bEPwYbUkOlA,2,"I don't understand why Yelp has two separate listings for the same restaurant? Oh well ... my review covers them both:

It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. 

Actually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. 

The food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",ScgUWBtv2XxrFzEMar5tcw,2,"It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass.

IB_lUegZ1PLvk44v8z8_AA,4,"It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and my friend and I just ventured out of a nearby lululemon store searching for the perfect place to eat and drink away any memory of all of the money spent. We found this Italian chophouse with a piano in the window and decided to give it a go. 

After being seated at a very nice table, we were greeted by a wonderful server, who was extremely knowledgeable and considerate to our requests. She recommended two excellent full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon to match our meal. 

Now the meal: 

For starters, she brought out this bread that was fresh out of the oven; so hot that when we ""broke bread"", it was an eruption of delicious steam that stimulated our sense of olfaction so much that we had to order seconds. My girlfriend has a rather odd sense of taste if you ask me (something she likes to call ""refined""), and doesn't like blue cheese- but not to worry! Our delightful waitress was very accommodating as to split the salad in half and include the blue cheese on mine and put fresh Mozzarella on hers. As they have a renowned raw bar, I also ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was great as expected. 

For the main course, I ordered the Veal Parmigiana (which was originally chicken until she allowed me to substitute the veal) and she ordered the Chicken Piccata. Both were phenomenal and a testament to how extraordinary this restaurant is. In a place where great Italian food is limited, Timpano really takes the cake. 

Why 4 stars and not 5? 

They did not have Feta cheese for the salad that she wanted.

They pride themselves on their hand aged meats, and since I did not order them I could not give them the 5 stars. I will for sure try it next time. 


Definitely a place to go for a great dinner, or even lunch.

Now for an updated review: If you don't care about being in an unfriendly and unprofessional environment, this would be the perfect salon for you. Yes, it is a cheap & affordable alternative than going to other high end salons in the area BUT this place is not what it used to be. I loved this salon before but I'm not sure if the management changed or the stylists just stopped giving a rats ass. For one, when you walk in the salon YOU DON'T feel the least bit welcomed. The receptionist is beyond ratchet. Like BEYOND! From gossiping to outright falling asleep at the desk. Yes, falling asleep! For two, none of the good stylists with the exception of one named Carl even works here anymore. I wish that I could post pictures of how bad my hair came out but since I started taking it out as soon as I hopped in my car I can't. $100.00 down the drain. The stylist who did my hair was named Brandy. Brandy took THREE HOURS to do a sew in. A bad one at that. My braids were loose and bumpy. The tracks were spread so far apart! She had a nice attitude but the poor baby just didn't know what she was doing. She said that she went to beauty school but the only thing she did good was cut my bang. The rest looked absolutely horrible. She told me she had only been there for two weeks and that should have been que to get up. If you need a cheap sew in go here, but if you have the money do yourself a favor and go somewhere that's gonna do quality work."

Further update: we've been back several times and both the service and food have been excellent.  We've recently moved to a plant-based diet and they are very accommodating with the menu. Particularly like the black bean burger (no cheese) and the juju veggie sandwich.  The fruit side is a nice option"

Now to the food, we started off with the antipasto, a weekend special, and it was amazing. Prosciutto, mortadella, sharp provolone, stuffed peppers and many other things, marinated in a delicious oil, it was perfect. 
I got the porterhouse steak special next topped with Gorgonzola and an amazing steak sauce. Cooked veggies and mashed potatoes on the side, it was perfectly cooked and everything went perfect with the next thing. My girlfriend got the lasagna which had the best mozzarella cheese I've had, and the sauce was also amazing.

We ordered appetizers and a main course. We skipped lunch and were starving so would have been happy with anything served. 

My first dish was a ceviche and it was not good. It was missing that right amount of sour flavor and tasted like defrosted fish. It did not have the right amount of spices that a good ceviche should have.

My entree was the gluten free mahi mahi dish with risotto. It was good, but nothing to write home about. It was a good hearty meal with decent presentation without any wow factors to it in flavor.

Finally - we ended the meal on a high note. They make this gluten free lava cake out of corn starch that was great. It was nice and soft inside and paired with salted caramel ice cream. I would recommend it even to those who do not follow a gluten free diet.

M.L. Rose isn't bad, but it's not great.  I love the concept.  They are a burger place that offers an above average beer selection.  That's a great start!

The problem is their execution.  The beer list is good.  It could probably be a bit better since 'craft beer' is actually in their name.  However, I have no complaints with their above average selection.  However, the food is very average.  They could do a better job and I would lump their burgers into this group.  Unfortunately, I would have to say that this is you classic example of bar food.

I do come here occasionally and always enjoy myself.  It's a fun atmosphere and the service is good and very friendly.  They also sponsor Nashville Sports Leagues and I love the folks that give back to their community.  I've been there several times just because of that relationship.

k2yWHUJulsxi8c-vL_otVA,1,"Went there since someone recommended the bakery.

We definitely received white people treatment at an Asian restaurant which happens and it's fine. When we sat down the woman immediately took the chop sticks off the table and brought back forks. Then we ordered hot tea and when we got that we weren't quite ready to order so we said we needed a few minutes. Once we were ready I couldn't get anyone to come over for at least 15 minutes. I finally flagged down someone who was running by. 

The BBQ pork wonton soup was ok. The Mongolian beef was supposed to be spicy, but came out really bland.

A quick 30-40 minute lunch took over 1 hour and 15 minutes. Kind of ridiculous. 

We skipped the bakery but will eventually try to just walk in and pick up something next time, not sitting down to eat.",N8e_ECkGCIs9FPqP1QTW7g,1,"Went there since someone recommended the bakery and figured we'd get lunch and maybe something sweet.

IVRASotwJyGtUk_N8ewjBQ,5,"I just had my 45th birthday party at Marmont last night and I couldn't have been more pleased. Let me start with booking the event, Dave (the owner) was as easy as pie to work with, he helped me with every little detail. I'm a little picky, but he was patient as could be.

Casey, helped me create a custom martini as the drink special for my party,he concocted a delectable coconut, cherry, lime martini and my guest simply loved them, let me tell you Leah-tini's are delicious! Ask for one.

The food was simply incredible! My guests feasted on three courses of hot appetizers, we had jumbo garlic fried shrimp (to die for!), calamari with jalepenos (crisp, crunchy, full of flavor), steak spring rolls (beefy, cheesy, yummy), cheese fries and Dave was nice enough to add spicy buffalo wings to my party food menu for the night. Some of my guest ordered other items as well, the crab cakes got rave reviews!

The DJ kept us dancing all night with a combination of dance music, pop music and selections from a playlist I gave to Dave, I danced almost the entire night!

Most importantly the staff was the nicest most attentive people ever, the wait staff was always smiling, full of personality and eager to please. The bar staff never had anyone wait longer than a few seconds to place thier drink order. Even the security guard was nice (big dude-I wouldn't mess with him!) but he was very kind and cordial the entire night.

You know you can have great ambiance, food and music but if the staff isn't up to par it can ruin a night. I was so lucky to have these people here catering to my guests.

Unfortunately, it is expensive. In addition, yesterday I went in again and several products had no prices (namely, the butter, which I had intended to buy). I realize the quick changeover must've been a nightmare, but it was frustrating to find missing prices. I did report it, and was assured that would be fixed soon. 
Also, last time I'd bought the Haggen brand of ice cream, only to discover later that the 4th ingredient on the list was corn syrup solids. The Haggen brand of cinnamon rolls had corn syrup and corn syrup solids. I know sweet rolls and ice cream are hardly health food but why add corn syrup?

FzN9a9iDOEQAUNXwfa3mYQ,1,"Here's their slogan:  ""Moving is hard.  Green Truck makes it harder! ""

I'll give you a breakdown of their rate structure:  

They charge $115 per hour for a two man crew with a two and a half hour minimum.  You're thinking, ""The last time I moved this one bedroom apartment worth of stuff it was just me a friend and it didn't take two hours.  Surely professionals will take less time than that!""  You will be wrong.

At the $115 an hour rate, you want these guys to hustle.  They will not.  Anything that is not in a box will be meticulously wrapped in a moving blanket and covered in tape.  I mean, EVERYTHING will be individually wrapped.  Not just fragile items.  They would wrap your Brita pitcher.  This is their prime means of riding the clock and screwing you out of your money.  Remember: they don't have a sense of urgency.  They're just two dudes riding the clock.  The less of a hurry they're in, the more money they make.

So a job that should be knocked out in two and a half hours will take four and a half.  That's $517.50 as a base rate.

Then comes their ""transportation fee"".  This fee is not for transporting your things to your new place.  This is a fee for driving from their office downtown to your house, and then back when they're done.  It works out to about $160 an hour (they charged me $86 for what was at most 30 minutes of drive time).  They want $160 an hour to drive and empty truck to and from work.  

They also tack on 10% for fuel charges.  At my day job I dispatch trucks, and adding on a fuel surcharge is common.  But the way Green does it is not honest, nor is it the industry standard in trucking.  Honest trucking companies charge a fuel surcharge based on the distance traveled.  For instance, Nashville to Smyrna should be about ten dollars. But Green charges you fuel based on the total move time, not the total travel time.   They charge for ""fuel"" when they're not driving the truck.  I paid $51.75 in fuel for ten minutes of drive time.  

So to move a one bedroom apartment with no stairs, they will charge you about $665.",-qNVH2DNqiy7uxIraqJM0A,1,"Here's their slogan:  ""Moving is hard.  Green Truck makes it harder! ""

ig2Z4QgpxgNDgX0qvACaVg,4,"This Whole Foods location opened up a couple months ago, but it is not new to the Main Line. 

Another Whole Foods was located about 2 minutes down Wynnewood Avenue. However, that location had horrible parking as it was shared with some local businesses like Sang Kee and Dakota Pizza. The location was also on the smaller side causing overcrowding. Also, it was a bit old. 

By moving to the new, bigger location they believed they were fixing those issues. They addressed the problem, head on, they fixed most but I am not sure they fixed them all. 

First, they built an indoor and outdoor parking lot. However, these are always packed and it is always a struggle to find a parking spot. When it is very crowded workers have to direct traffic. One time, a small fight broke out. The traffic pattern can be confusing as well. 

Other than that there are no real glaring issues about this location. Compared to the last location, this store is much bigger, cleaner and has a much better and healthier variety.

For example, the carts here are XL, a full size tavern and beer garden are downstairs and a juice and Smoothie bar is available. They have also expanded upon the salad bar, sushi bar, pizza kitchen and bakery.

Food wise, I absolutely love this stores hoagies. Their seasonal ""thanksgiving feast"" hoagie is off the charts. They have a somewhat ""healthy"" candy bar, which has amazing fruit snacks. Finally, their salad bar is delicious with so many options from types of lettuce, to dressing, to croutons, proteins and fruits and veggies. 

This location is also environmentally friendly as it uses as little energy as little. They have non-moving check-outs and they have large factory type lights, which use less energy altogether. 

Lastly, the staff here is phenomenal. They are welcoming, helpful, well-informed and know how to make good food. 

Will definitely return.",DoRAaktgFG1RrUL6QwWJag,4,"This is such an awesome location, but they persist continue to persist with the same issues. This Whole Foods location opened up a couple months ago, but it is not new to the Main Line.

5AUk2ITwhnsZ2ZvQTP0Y2A,1,"After reading the positive reviews on here, I decided to give Sam's a try.  We arrived shortly after 5 PM on a weekday, so we were the only people in the restaurant until the over 65 crowd started arriving.  The decor is interesting - light colored wood slats cover the walls up to the high ceilings and somewhat mismatched booths and tables below.  It is almost reminiscent of a ski lodge, albeit one with the tables a little too close together.

We were promptly greeted, seated, ordered our drinks (their fresh-brewed ice tea) and began to browse the sparse menu.  If you don't want a burger or some grilled chicken concoction, this place is likely not for you.  We ordered the Thanksgiving on a ""French"" roll (no sides included, I ordered onion rings) and the walnut chicken with fries, applesauce and some strange-looking honey dip with pepper flakes (it tasted a bit better than it looked).

Our food arrived ~15 mins later as other diners gradually began to fill the establishment.  We were fortunate enough to choose one of the few tables that had ketchup and as I began to create a pool on my plate, I noticed this bottle had seen better days.   In fact, all of the ketchup bottles out had - the labels were oddly faded in a way that suggested these bottles had been ""washed"" and re-filled.  Come to think of it, the ketchup didn't taste like Heinz either.  Give me a break.

It got better, my soft roll was crusty on the edges from being cut and left to sit around, the turkey dry (which is supposedly roasted on site) and the stuffing bland.  The only redeeming quality of my meal was the cranberry sauce and the pre-packaged onion rings.

The walnut chicken seemed like a good idea, but also lacked flavor and the mountain of shoestring fries were not evenly seasoned with what appeared to be a ""Cajun"" seasoning.  The clear pepper flake laced jelly on the side did not look appetizing, tasted ok, but could do little to salvage this meal.

Overall, we could have easily made a better meal at home for less money - the bill came to $33 with tip.  There is a simple lack of quality and attention to detail.  It is obvious they get their weekly order from the restaurant supplier, put things together with as little effort as possible and call it a ""grill joint"".  If you are in the area, you'd do better with the Applebee's or the Subway across the street.  Even better yet, fire up the grill at home - you can't do any worse.

kO34vqZSYSslQZATuhA8-w,4,"I've been a fan of Malena's since she opened five years ago.  You can tell that she picks each of her pieces with care and experience.  In a store that sells 90% vintage merchandise (10% rockabilly apparel), you'll be hard-pressed to find anything below excellent condition.

The boutique also showcases local fashion design talent such as Nicole Ray Styer.

My favorite part about Malena's (and most other shops in West Chester) is their First Friday Event.  The first Friday of every month, the boutique stays open late, serves drinks and Hor D'oeuvres and has a big sale.  A great way to spend a friday!

ecm7PxAsyzph33BtSeBPOA,1,"There are so many other city water parks out there that are more reasonable in price. Regardless, we have patronized this park numerous times and for it just being the 2nd year of operation, there have been several equipment failures. Seems like every time we visit, something is: ""broken & wont be in operation"" for either hours or, the entire day. Last Sunday the kiddie water park and the smaller tubes were out of commission so the only venue now is, the big swimming pool or, the Lazy river. After an hour, the lazy river looked like hundreds of refugees in floating ashore or one of those carnival duck games, you choose which. Now, the curious thing here is that you have a long wait in line only to be told AFTER YOU HAVE PAID ADMISSION that one of the pools or the lazy river is out of commission for the day. Nice huh? It's almost like they train their teenaged employees to ""get the cash first"" then let em' know the reality of the situation. The food is expensive & not terribly good. 
All in all, the City of Greenwood is perpetuating a sort of highway robbery.

After paying her admission and then learning the kiddie area was closed for the day I witnessed a woman in line ask for her money back as her small grandkids now had nothing for them. The teenager at the desk actually rolled her eyes and said she would have to get the manager. The manager was also condescending to the lady but, returned her admission.   Nice huh?

Update.  Made an appointment yesterday for  today to have my new set of tires installed.  This time they were ready for me and service went smoothly.  The tires were installed in 1 1/2 to 2 hours while we waited and shopped at nearby businesses like Savers and JoAnn's craft store.  We ate nearby at La Michoacana... (See review).  The car feels great with new tires and because I don't use my car often, at $336.08, for four new General tires, it was a great buy.  Met Lavone LaRue, a very pleasant fellow, in the service department's cashier area."

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

etKhQqNXU2u56gwEI8HZiA,5,"When asked what my favorite place to eat here in New Orleans, I always pause and ponder. But really, one place always comes to mind immediately... and it's Bacchanal. 

Bacchanal is a triple threat - good atmosphere, good music, and good food. The steak is always a good
choice and the shaved brussel sprouts. Even if you're just stopping by for a snack, a cheese board is a good call. This is a spot that will satisfy both the meat eater and the vegetarian. 

I will say that I've seen this place change quite a bit over the years. Some good changes, some bad. The food situation has improved immensely. And the addition of the bar upstairs means that you can enjoy Bacchanal year round. However the wine selection has gotten pricier and the crowds are huge nowadays. On a decent night, definitely expect a good wait before getting a table outside while the live music is going. 
Still I find myself returning to Bacchanal again and again and being satisfied each time. I live in the neighborhood now which helps too. 

Bacchanal has so much to offer that you're bound to enjoy yourself one way or another. Whether it's the delicious food, or the local live music, or the extensive wine and cheese selection, or just sitting outside with good company on a beautiful New Orleans night in one of the coolest neighborhoods in town, Bacchanal is a treat.

I will say that I've seen this place change quite a bit over the years. Some good changes, some bad. The food situation has improved immensely. And the addition of the bar upstairs means that you can enjoy Bacchanal year round. However the wine selection has gotten pricier and the crowds are huge nowadays. On a decent night, definitely expect a good wait before getting a table outside while the live music is going. Still I find myself returning to Bacchanal again and again and being satisfied each time. I live in the neighborhood now which helps too. 

Bacchanal has so much to offer that you're bound to enjoy yourself one way or another. Whether it's the delicious food, or the local live music, or the extensive wine and cheese selection, or just sitting outside with good company on a beautiful New Orleans night in one of the coolest neighborhoods in town, Bacchanal is a treat. 

RIP Bacchus."

LA_nHifcHgQkhE36CrSolg,4,"Update:
I'm a fan of all their tacos. They are always generously stuffed with meat, however their  horchata (rice drink) is horrible. It tastes like water with some bland powder. Their horchata is not authentic at all. Would have been great with the tacos however they go great with a beer or coke. Delivery is generally fast and friendly. Some of the females answering the phone seem immature which make it difficult to place a phone order because they seem absent minded and laugh just about every other word because they can't pronounce items on the menu and don't even know their menu. It helped I had a menu and had to speak slowly to the lady and repeat it numerous times. It was annoying, but the food was worth it. Delivery is only $1 which is great. 

Ordered the beef tacos. There's no menu online so I asked what kind of tacos and if they came with any sides. The beef tacos are a fajita kind diced into nice small pieces but stuffed with a generous amount of meat. They don't come with any sides. That was the only good thing from this place. I ordered a side of rice and what I received was bland white rice. The chicken flautas would have been good if the chicken wasn't dry. They were stuffed with a generous amount of chicken too. The lady answering the phone and taking my order was completely rude. She said the tacos come with fries and they didn't. Looking at the menu they brought me they don't say that. At the end she just hung up on me. She was asinine and I could see why. Her job is too complex for her. I would go there again only for the tacos.",q3XO5SE6TRctRalhbQvfKA,2,Ordered the beef tacos.

The Pho is also very very good... it comes to the table piping hot with fresh sprouts and basil to add as desire.  I found that a few good doses of rooster sauce (sriracha) brought the flavor to just where I like it.

I don't have much to say to her because she continues to show her unprofessionalism especially with how she chooses to express herself and handle a negative review from an unpaid customer. I wonder if she has texted every person who said something positive about their experience? Luckily I'm a positive person and will just perceive her actions as an attempt at customer service.

Even the pork shoulder had a sweet glaze on it that did not appeal to me and I didn't bother to finish the pork shoulder. The noodles were hard, clumped together and I didn't get enough broth with my ramen. Good thing I was very hungry, otherwise I wouldn't have finished eating the miso ramen. 

This place is also expensive for Philly. The miso ramen is $14. This is Philly not NYC. I have paid ~$15 for good ramen in NYC. 

I also had an unimpressive sangria...small glass filled with mostly ice for $10. 

The decorative lights made it feel like it was Christmas.

CoA5urbRnFmWZtowZpmBrQ,5,"The Clearwater area has been in dire need for a sushi spot like this!

This restaurant offers an excellent all you can eat sushi and hibachi menu along with plenty of appetizers and soups to choose from. For dinner the price is very reasonable at $17.95 per person and kids 4-8 are only $4.99! Can you even get a happy meal for that price? Our daughter loves sushi and Chicken Teriyaki so she was in heaven. If you aren't into sushi that's ok as you can choose from a wide array of dinner items. 

Please note this is not a buffet style place like many other places in the area. You place your order from the menu they give you and then they make the items for you and bring them out. This is better as you know they are making it fresh for you and it hasn't been sitting on some warmer exposed to the public with a chance of people breathing all over it.

We went on a Monday night around 6:30 and it was nice and quiet as we were the only ones in the restaurant. The inside is very nicely decorated and doesn't quite feel like a Japanese restaurant with the tasteful decor they have.

We had a few of the rolls on the menu including Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls along with a Mexican roll off of the standard rolls menu. Each one was amazing and you could tell everything was fresh as it melted in your mouth and the fish had no smell whatsoever. The spicy rolls are not really spicy so if you like it hot ask for it Extra Spicy to kick it up a notch.

Where the good rolls are at is in the Signature Rolls section which is included in the menu. I know some other places in Pinellas County where they charge you extra for these. We had a large variety including The Hawaii, Rainbow, Dancing Krab, Green Sarabay, Saki, Volcano and the Crunchy 2 in 1. Wow that sounds like a lot! Our favorite by far was the Volcano which was baked and topped with Krab and spicy mayo. I'm not usually a fan of cooked rolls but this was amazing. Another to recommend is the Crunchy 2 in 1. Our goal is to try every roll they have as the menu is quite extensive.

Make sure to only order what you know you will eat as they will charge you for any pieces you leave up to .75 per piece I believe.

The server was always smiling and very courteous and made us feel welcomed. By the time we left, the restaurant was starting to fill up.

My friend wanted the mofongo but was on the fence because she doesn't like Dominican mofongo. The owner assured us that that all of the Puerto Rican customers seemed very pleased with the dish. She ordered one for herself and we both loved it. We were so impressed that we ordered 4 to go to feed our families for dinner.

I ordered the vaca con tostones and was equally impressed. The skirt steak was very well seasoned. Even though the steak was on top of the tostones, the tostones were crispy and delicious.

UPDATE:

After having such a positive experience, my friend and I returned yesterday. Wow, what a change. The service was terrible. We ordered a pork mofongo and a shrimp mofongo. 1+1=2, right? Well, the waitress didn't think so. She only brought the pork mofongo. She argued with my friend about what was ordered, which was very unprofessional. Not to mention the fact that she was flat-out wrong. She said she would bring out the shrimp mofongo in 20 minutes. Instead, she brought a plate of shrimp. Again, she argued about what we ordered and tried to charge us for the plate of shrimp! The owner was sitting nearby and heard the whole ordeal. He never intervened or apologized. Again, very unprofessional and overall terrible, especially for a new restaurant trying to build its reputation. 

On the upside, the pork mofongo was delicious so props to the chef. I just wish the rest of the experience had been more positive."

RQ-ohDg4oJ7E-Nt-HEhAmA,1,"This is our 4th and final time to book this hotel. The service and rooms are simply inexcusable in this price range. For $300+ per night we were booked in a room that was small, poorly appointed and had a malfunctioning AC unit that made loud noise all night. The noise sounded like brakes grinding on metal. It was beyond loud and kept waking us up during the night. The room I booked was supposed to have a couch but didn't. The final straw was the valet service when we were leaving. Waited 20 minutes for the car. This was a mid week stay and the traffic was slower than a weekend. The wait was quite frustrating but to make matters worse, 2 of the employees decided to stand in front of the exit lane to chat while I am trying to leave.

The service and rooms are simply inexcusable in this price range. For $300+ per night we were booked in a room that was small, poorly appointed and had a malfunctioning AC unit that made loud noise all night. The noise sounded like brakes grinding on metal. It was beyond loud and kept waking us up during the night. The room I booked was supposed to have a couch but didn't. The final straw was the valet service when we were leaving. Waited 20 minutes for the car. This was a mid week stay and the traffic was slower than a weekend. The wait was quite frustrating but to make matters worse, 2 of the employees decided to stand in front of the exit lane to chat while I am trying to leave. They kept talking and it took me another 5 minutes to exit after I had already gotten my car. I actually had to honk my horn to get their attention.

Sadly I joined the CG in 2003 & haven't been back as frequently as I'd have liked. I was always holding out hope I'd get stationed nearby. From the B.L.A.T that was always served with perfect & plenty of bacon & avocado to the Cajun chicken sub that had that touch of zest to it everything was always amazing!

I remember the cooler being filled with novelty style sodas of Moxie & Sarsaparillas while the walls were covered in cool signs & newspaper articles about the great things the Plaza Deli was doing! I have so many fond memories about this spot & cannot wait to come back into SB for even a day to grab me something delicious! 

Seriously, I don't think I ever had a bad sandwich from them! I would always order a 2nd sub to throw in a cooler bag when I was leaving town & it would still be on point hours later. This place was my go to spot for so long, I need to come back & say hey to the owner who's name escapes me at the moment, but he always recognized me no matter how long it had been. Larry!!

In a store that sells 90% vintage merchandise (10% rockabilly apparel), you'll be hard-pressed to find anything below excellent condition.

The boutique also showcases local fashion design talent such as Nicole Rae Styer.

My favorite part about Malena's (and most other shops in West Chester) is their First Friday Event.  The first Friday of every month, the boutique stays open late, serves drinks and Hor D'oeuvres and has a big sale.  A great way to spend a friday!

It was mid afternoon and the place was not overly busy.  So I tried a few beers, at a table away from the bar.  The beers remain good, worth trying and i am sure that when I return the beers will be equally good and there will be different folks working the bar.

It's street parking only, so be prepared to have to walk a bit from your car if you are coming during peak hours. 

The decor is contemporary. It's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It was also very packed. I was alone, so I sat at the bar. 

It took about 5 minutes to get served at the bar because they were so busy. However, once I was served, the food came really quickly. 

I had the pork belly tacos and the spicy beef pho. Both were amazing. The tacos had so much flavor, and the beef was so tender in the pho. The pricing is pretty on par with most of the places around the city. $9-$10 for a nice big bowl of pho, and $5 for the tacos.

Update since I just drove said car for the first time since work done.   My teen age son is primary driver.   
So I just noticed the mileage on the reminder sticker is wrong.    Many places put the mileage on the sticker that you get a new change(or a date).  Some may put on the mileage when this oil change was done.   This location out in a number that was neither.   The mileage is about 500 miles off what it should have been if it was the mileage when job done.   In other words it appears that they are trying to get their customers to think oil changes are needed quicker than they actually are."

I went to Zagol for lunch yesterday because I got a coupon from Living Social.  When I informed the owner of the deal I had, she asked me if I had the coupon printed out.  I politely informed her that I do not print the coupons because it is a mobile application and it says to show the coupon on the phone.  I have never had to print a coupon from Living Social or Groupon.  She then went on to say, in a very accusatory manner, ""How do I know you won't go back and print the coupon and try to use it twice?"" I explained to her that the unique verification code can only be used once.  She then got mad at ME saying how the coupon company didn't tell her when the coupon would be activated.  I'm sorry, but how was this my fault and why must she yell at me for it?! SHE signed up for the deal and should have read the information prior to agreeing to do the deal! All this before I was even seated to eat. Grrr. I thought about flipping her the bird and leaving, but I held my composure.   Another group of people came in immediately after me with the Living Social coupon on their phone, and she was as sweet as cherry freaking pie to them. Whatever...
The food had good flavor, but I will say that for $10, there should be MUCH larger portions.  You eat with your hands which is fun, but the amount that was served looked like they portioned it with a single hand scoop as well. Since when did peas and carrots cost $10 for a single ladle? 
The lady was back in he kitchen for a long period of time, so I left my 50 cent tip plus 2 pennies for my ""2 cents"" and bailed.  I have never left such a measly tip before, but this lady didn't deserve and ounce of my business to begin with.

My order was also made quickly, even with me waiting behind another customer. My drink still wasn't very hot but definitely an improvement from this past weekend. I am happy to re-rate The Blind Tiger. Thank you Roberto! We should have more local businesses show this much care. 

Initial Review:
I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",8izdGftq1oOKxOJtw-UAeg,1,"I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning.

Also there is one member of the staff that clearly doesn't know how to speak to people in a respectful manner.. before we even sat down to try our beer there he rudely said ""I would love to see your IDs"".. the way he said it made me feel like I was underage again. I'm 27 years old, 6 years past the legal drinking age. I don't like to be treated like I'm doing something wrong by ordering a beer.. good beer, place just needs an attitude adjustment and maybe to drop their can prices.. 18 is pushing it but 25 for a 4 pack is just a little too rich for my blood."

First up the salad: the size was great and the toppings of salami, pepperoni, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and roasted tomatoes were delicious. I wish they would have used other lettuce other than just ice berg, but otherwise I can highly recommend it. 
Next up the pizzas: They were delicious. The Lasagna Pizza was unique and very tasty. I've never had ricotta on pizza and discovered a new topping I really enjoy. The pepperoni and mushroom had a generous amount of toppings. Both pies were baked perfectly. They both deserves a strong four out of five stars.

The place is not all that big and on this night there were maybe four of roughly a dozen tables full. Inexplicably, there were six servers and three bartenders on duty, all of whom were huddled around the server station at the bar SINCE THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO. We were thence subjected to the staff's conversations, which, astoundingly never included frustrated mumblings about when the hell some servers would get cut for the night. 
So what's worse than being suffocated by catty waitstaff and bartenders all talking behind one another's backs all night? The fact that even in this sea of service professionals we still had to go out of our way to get subsequent rounds of drinks and water refills. 
I won't bore you with the insanely shitty, passive aggressive, bs we had play out inches in front of our faces as a bartender did dishes while taking a colleague to task for failing to serve a dish with a steak knife.

bXdkhOT72YmxGT8zqqwTZA,1,"I've been trying to get in this place since it opened weeks ago but the line was always too long. This time the lines were non existent. After sampling 7 different items on the menu I can see why. In a nutshell... The food is terrible. The pulled pork sandwich was dry as the Sahara. Potato wedges were bland, tasteless and soggy.  Not to mention the larger ones were undercooked.  The mashed potatoes were like trying to eat a container of white playdoh. How about the fries?  Listen... if you can't make French fries crispy then stop making them. Maybe salt on them would help but probably not. The Mac and cheese had zero flavor and the texture made me think it was microwaved Mac and cheese from the dollar store sitting on your countertop for a few hours. The fried chicken breading flavor wasn't terrible but it was wet and soggy. That's a no no. It's fried chicken for Gods sake. CRISPY please!  Lastly the  biscuits... What can I say? Dry and tasteless. Did I say dry? I did. Big disappointment. One star is too much for this joint. I give the place 6 months.

The food is spectacular. I had never tried Cambodian food but found the spice blends to be EXTREMELY agreeable and complimentary to the meats and veggies they were cooked with. Get the meatballs. Wrap them in lettuce and dip them in the spicy sweet sauce. Get the caramelized pork in coconut. Get the 4 mushroom lemon grass pork in the banana leaf. The only reason I would NOT reorder these items is to try the rest of the menu. I want everything. Byob (though we didn't last night, couldn't find a liquor store) is a nice option, and the family that owns Khmer is SO accommodating and cool.

GG0TFle51NYokPtBAUYGqg,5,"Thank god there is now a Costco on the southside. I love this place but ... The north side location is too far away to take full advantage. 

Good selection is nice... And a lot of things I've found a very sufficient savings on; eggs, some condiments, coconut water and more. 

I like finding little gadgets that somehow are both practical and something I've meant to buy... Just hadn't taken the time. 

I used my ""free pizza"" voucher recently and was happy with the pie. Even at 9.99, it seemed like a fair deal when one does not feel like doing any food prep after unloading a vehicle. A vehicle that has an extra $100 worth of shit I didn't plan on buying when I walked in the door. 

The staff has been helpful... Samples are convenient, as are the trash cans so I do not carry shrapnel from 7 samples through every aisle as I must make sure I haven't missed anything new. 

Some things are way too large of a supply for me unless having a party or the decision I love rice to the tune of 20+Lbs. to each their own. 

I have a feeling when I check my 2% balance I'm both going both be happy at the ""free"" money, but there could be a little sticker shock of what that means I've spent here. 

The only downside is sometimes you have to watch out for inconsiderate people. I spent half of today finding ways around people. When you are in an aisle and can't get out...

I also enjoyed a horchata latte... very good! If you're in the Gulch it's worth checking out.

Casey, helped me create a custom martini as the drink special for my party,he concocted a delectable coconut, cherry, lime martini and my guest simply loved them, let me tell you Leah-tini's are delicious! Ask for one.

The food was simply incredible! My guest feasted on three courses of hot appetizers, we had jumbo garlic fried shrimp (to die for!), calamari with jalepenos (crisp, crunchy, full of flavor), steak spring rolls (beefy, cheesy, yummy), cheese fries and Dave was nice enough to add spicy buffalo wings to my party food menu for the night. Some of my guest ordered other items as well, the crab cakes got rave reviews!

The DJ kept us dancing all night with a combination of dance music, pop music and selections from a playlist I gave to Dave, I danced almost the entire night!

Most importantly the staff was the nicest most attentive people ever, the wait staff was always smiling, full of personality and eager to please. The bar staff never had anyone wait longer than a few seconds to place thier drink order. Even the security guard was nice (big dude-I wouldn't mess with him!) but he was very kind and cordial the entire night.

Best deep dish this side of the south side..... what a great crust, buttery and crunchy even  on the bottom.  Well worth the wait for a fresh deep dish chicago style!  Why, oh why did we wait so long to hear of this seminole heights jewel?!   Only other place slightly close to this outside of  Chicago is Joey Ds and that is 45 minutes those of us in Tampa dont meed to drive!!!  Great service, quaint decor....YUM!!!!  We will be back!

H9SIKlX9fuJj1LrT-iveUA,3,"I came here on a Friday around 9ish and the place had a nice crowd. They had $1 domestic bottles that night, a price you cannot beat! They play really great music here and have plenty of flat screens to catch a game. They also have this really fun hook game by the front entrance. The place fills up really quick specially around 11ish. I requested a song from the DJ but it was never played and I was there for over 2 hours. Also one of the bathroom door lock in the women's bathroom was broken. Also they don't have any drafts, only bottles. It's not the greatest place I've ever been to but it's a cheap spot that plays great music. PS no hats allowed even though it's a sports bar..that's a little odd.",7FeqD7QpW4bMfrHDBQ7M4A,3,"I came here on a Friday around 9ish and the place had a nice crowd.

the old fashion southern way like how his great Aunt made it.  The grits here were rich smooth creamy and satisfying.  But the shrimps with bacon with the red eye sauce is what shined.  I practically licked the plate.  We also ordered gumbo ya ya and crab cake on a bed of Maque Choux.  I could'nt finish everything but the maque choux was so delicious I had to scoop up the remainder to go so I could enjoy later.

For dessert we enjoyed the mixed berry cobbler. It was a very memorable meal.

This is an update I need to mention:

Upon arriving home and and later checking our credit card statement for which we used to pay our tab, we found that the waiter that served us took it upon himself to add a couple of bucks plus to his tip on our credit card after we had already signed our credit card slip.  We were more than appropriate with his tip. Maybe most people don't compare their signed slips with their CC statements and they can get away with this. I know it's just a couple of dollars but this practice is soooo unethical. 

I have been to Mr.B's a handful of times when visiting and have been happy with the food and service but this has really tarnished it for me.  I can't ever return here."

-qNVH2DNqiy7uxIraqJM0A,1,"Here's their slogan:  ""Moving is hard.  Green Truck makes it harder! ""

I'll give you a breakdown of their rate structure:  

They charge $115 per hour for a two man crew with a two and a half hour minimum.  You're thinking, ""The last time I moved this one bedroom apartment worth of stuff it was just me a friend and it didn't take two hours.  Surely professionals will take less time than that!""  You will be wrong.

At the $115 an hour rate, you want these guys to hustle.  They will not.  Anything that is not in a box will be meticulously wrapped in a moving blanket and covered in tape.  I mean, EVERYTHING will be individually wrapped.  Not just fragile items.  They would wrap your Brita pitcher.  This is their prime means of riding the clock and screwing you out of your money.  Remember: they don't have a sense of urgency.  They're just two dudes riding the clock.  The less of a hurry they're in, the more money they make.

So a job that should be knocked out in two and a half hours will take four and a half.  That's $517.50 as a base rate.

Then comes their ""transportation fee"".  This fee is not for transporting your things to your new place.  This is a fee for driving from their office downtown to your house, and then back when they're done.  It works out to about $160 an hour (they charged me $86 for what was at most 30 minutes of drive time).  They want $160 an hour to drive and empty truck to and from work.  

They also tack on 10% for fuel charges.  At my day job I dispatch trucks, and adding on a fuel surcharge is common.  But the way Green does it is not honest, nor is it the industry standard in trucking.  Honest trucking companies charge a fuel surcharge based on the distance traveled.  For instance, Nashville to Smyrna should be about ten dollars. But Green charges you fuel based on the total move time, not the total travel time.   They charge for ""fuel"" when they're not driving the truck.  I paid $51.75 in fuel for ten minutes of drive time.  

So to move a one bedroom apartment with no stairs, they will charge you about $665.",FzN9a9iDOEQAUNXwfa3mYQ,1,"Here's their slogan:  ""Moving is hard.  Green Truck makes it harder! ""

4W-HwNCHMqeaXjmau-NvyA,3,"I've been there at least 6 times since June, and I *really* want this to be a 5-star review! I love the menu, the focus on healthy and high quality ingredients, and the number of options available to someone with a dairy allergy. Unfortunately, I don't think I've had a single visit without a glitch, including today. These include: 

*the manager (female) carrying washed cucumbers ready to be diced with her bare hands, no gloves (today)
*taking 15 min to make my meal (grain bowl) after I paid, even though there was only one other customer (today)
*a new and obviously stressed employee needing the manager's help to answer a phone question - finally the manager took the phone, was kind to the customer on the other end, but then was clearly and vocally annoyed with the phone customer after hanging up. I get it, but prob better not to do in front of another customer - me - waiting to order (today)
*finding a pumpkin bar (delicious!!) in the case in August with a June expiration date. 
*realizing my last trip before today that none of the bars have exp dates anymore, which is odd as they all used to and the packaging hasn't changed? Worried they may have removed the dates because they aren't moving them quickly enough?
*out of quinoa noodles one visit even though I came for lunch 
*getting chicken for the first time recently and it was the consistency of feta cheese? I even initially thought they got my order wrong and put cheese on it. It was just tiny pieces of chicken that kind of fell apart as you ate. Very different from some pics on here. (Did NOT get sick though)
*avocado left off one order, realized when I got home (no big deal)

Had to remove a star because I emailed Morgan (who responded and asked me to contact her) over three weeks ago and haven't heard back. I wasn't looking for a free meal, but I would rather not have taken the time to contact GG if no one planned to respond. Also, I was in the restaurant yesterday and once again saw two issues: an older man (may have been the owner) overcharged a couple for a smoothie, and there was a discussion at the table next to mine about it (he did refund the extra amount). Also, one of the employees knocked a stack of about 20 empty boxes (that all meals are served in) on the floor and picked them up and continued to put food in them. I guess only the sides and top hit the floor, but still - seems like they should've been tossed. Wanted to like GG so badly, but I've literally never been when there isn't some kind of issue!

I got a cluster or roses on my shoulder with some ""brush strokes"" of color on them. My tattoo artist is Eddie. He is very friendly and fun! He did exactly like I asked. He is a very good artist. His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here. You will be in good hands with some great artists and you will be just as happy as I am right now.

UPDATE: Just went to Stigma again and got a simple black arm band, courtesy of Santana. Even though it's a simple arm band, that type of tattoo isn't as simple to do as it looks.

Pros:
- Good Tasting Authentic Chinese Food
- Modern Dining Area
- Good Location
- Clean

Cons:
- Service is bad. Register girl taking personal phone calls while helping customers.
- Closed at 8pm one night, when the sign said 9pm.
- Chairs are uncomfortable.
- The people that work there present a language barrier.

TFtiIn3o-JZpWc94x_0pxA,3,"Have been here twice because my hubby saw a great deal online for a season membership. Honestly, the place is not horrible but just too far away for us (2hr ride). We have a toddler who LOVES the kiddie section which is tiny (infant to age 4/5) I have never been on the big slides so I can't comment on them. The lazy river, which I usually love, has a dirty feel and smell to it. 

The outside, when hot, is actually a nice surprise. They have a dj that plays music by the bar. (I have only been there on wknds therefore not sure how often DJ is there) the outside has a very cute and pretty cool kiddie section (probably for up to age 4/5).
The outside also includes a big wave pool.

Overall I think it is worth it if you have kids from toddler- about early teens, older would probably get bored. Try it if you don't have to travel too far. Arrive nice and early for close parking and no lines for entry. 

Oh they also have a small arcade indoors which again is cool for the ages I mentioned.

This is the type of place I want to like. I really want to support more adventurous restaurants in Isla Vista in hopes to garner more businesses that will try something more brave than the standard pizza, burger, and burrito that our town seems to know and love more than is healthy.

Unfortunately, I just can't give this place my business.

#1 It's dirty.
I'm all for a hole in the wall where everything isn't spic, spam, shiny, and chrome, but this place made me uncomfortable to eat inside. It's just straight up not clean, not to mention visually unappealing. Lotta grey and brown and weird spots everywhere.

#2 It's slow
This might not be such an issue if #1 wasn't a problem. But since it's an uncomfortable place to sit and wait, waiting 15-20 minutes in an empty restaurant where I'm afraid I might catch something isn't fun.

Now that I've vented...

The food here is actually not bad. The meats are juicy, tender, and fresh. The portions are large. The hummus is excellent. 

So, if you can wade through the atmosphere and experience, and are craving some mediterranean food, then call in your order and make sure you get it TO GO. Otherwise, try somewhere else.",pWqruL6snXop0RZOZLDabw,2,"Good food, poor service.

tUJGSqbeftZR81FQ0rekww,1,"My wife and I always use Hooters as our fall back restaurant because our kids love good chicken, and, their new expanded menu gives us so many more choices. This past Sunday, 10/31/16, we again found ourselves at Tyrone Hooters, my daughter ordered a buffalo chicken salad, son ordered boneless bbq wings, wife ordered tilapia salad, and I ordered the grouper sandwich. It was around 4 pm, so the restaurant wasn't that busy. Being we live on the Gulfcoast, my wife and I eat a good amount of seafood. When served, all dinners looked great...except the tilapia salad. Here was this huge bowl of salad with a tiny piece of fish on top...less than one ounce. Now, my grouper sandwich was $15, I had, at least, a six ounce piece of fish, if not larger. My wife was paying $10 for this salad. Living here in St. Pete...EVERYONE knows tilapia is one of the most inexpensive cuts of fish in the industry.  We asked the waitress if something could be done, she came back and said the Manager would be over soon. After a 17 minute wait, no Manager, but a second piece of identical size of cooked tilapia on a plate by itself. It was ridiculous to wait any longer for my wife to start eating, besides, the rest of us were almost done by now. When we got the check, on the bottom of it, it said ""Extra Meat Charge"" $7.99 Tilapia. The next line, it was charged off.  Here's what I've deducted using my hospitality experience:

1. If this is a corporate decision or procedure, guess what, Publix has one pound bags of tilapia on sale for $9.99...6-7 whole filet portions...PUBLIX!!!!!

2. Why would any experienced server look at that salad, seeing other seafood being served, and not question what she's looking at?????

3. If a server went to a ""Manager"" about the problem, and no Manager addressed the problem with the customer, did the server lie? Did the Manager choose not to engage the customer????  

I guess Hooters figures they're just too big to care if they lose four paying customers, because the failures started in the kitchen, surging right through the service chain to our table...I guess ""too big to fail"" really does exist.

We've been coming back regularly and today we waited 1 hour 10 minutes for our food to come out after ordering.

That's not the end of the world but for one detail:

The kicker was that the owner ( maybe he was a manager?) sat down next to us with his food and even told us our food would be out shortly. No apologies from anyone.

The food was as always, great.

We're hoping this was a fluke but the owner(?) was so disrespectful."

I got a cluster or roses on my shoulder with some ""brush strokes"" of color on them. My tattoo artist is Eddie. He is very friendly and fun! He did exactly like I asked. He is a very good artist. His line work is perfect and so I will be going back to him for more. I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here. You will be in good hands with some great artists and you will be just as happy as I am right now.

UPDATE: Just went to Stigma again and got a simple black arm band, courtesy of Santana. Even though it's a simple arm band, that type of tattoo isn't as simple to do as it looks. Gotta be able to do an extremely straight line. Good line work is the mark of a good tattoo artist. Santana is an awesome artist and very friendly. You gotta see his portfolio!

I could'nt finish everything but the maque choux was so delicious I had to scoop up the remainder to go so I could enjoy later.

For dessert we enjoyed the mixed berry cobbler. It was a very memorable meal.

I was here with my sister and her family 3 years ago for Thanksgiving and although we all did not order the traditional Thanksgiving meal, we all shared the different dishes and were completely happy with what we had.


This is an update I need to mention:

Upon arriving home and and later checking our credit card statement for which we used to pay our tab, we found that the waiter that served us took it upon himself to add a couple of bucks plus to his tip on our credit card after we had already signed our credit card slip.  We were more than appropriate with his tip. Maybe most people don't compare their signed slips with their CC statements and they can get away with this. I know it's just a couple of dollars but this practice is soooo unethical.

My wife and I randomly decided to stop in here and we are so glad we did. 

The Sag Paneer was amazing. Same with the chicken tikka masala and paal appam. 

Seriously. So good. 
Try this place if you want amazing Indian food with very reasonable pricing and great service. 

Thanks to India Sizzling 2 for making our dinner portion of date night a success!!!!



Update:
We have been here many times since I last posted. 
Every. Single. Time. The food is amazing and so flavorful. 

We love date night here.

Update: I returned to Stone Creek and had a much better experience and meal. The service was fantastic. I had the house salad and some sort of smothered chicken with seasonal vegetables. It was all delicious and you can't beat the early bird special. My husband had a steak and it was cooked just right. We will happily return."
_eElwqMWF_ujVQ5HHXChJw,5,"I drove 20 min to find this place because all of the other pho places around my apartment were closed on Sunday. It was well worth the drive. 

It's street parking only, so be prepared to have to walk a bit from your car if you are coming during peak hours. 

The decor is contemporary. It's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It was also very packed. I was alone, so I sat at the bar. 

It took about 5 minutes to get served at the bar because they were so busy. However, once I was served, the food came really quickly. 

I had the pork belly tacos and the spicy beef pho. Both were amazing. The tacos had so much flavor, and the beef was so tender in the pho. The pricing is pretty on par with most of the places around the city. $9-$10 for a nice big bowl of pho, and $5 for the tacos. 

I've been to about 7-8 different Vietnamese restaurants around the city, and this place is towards the top of my list.

I came here again and it was an overall another wonderful experience. 

 I got the vanilla chai tea latte again, they didn't have the sugar spoon, wasn't sure if this was a mistake or they are no longer doing it, but it was delicious as always. The salted caramel waffles were amazing, I asked for no bacon.  In the southern eggs Benedict the cornbread is the best part. I will admit I prefer sweets over savory which is why i found it just okay when it was pretty much perfection it it's appearance and taste from the description given. and a chocolate milkshake.

I sent him on his way......I paid the 69.00 trip fee.  So the estimate was $629.00 to install the faucet.  The serviceman adjusted the water flow in the toilets and said they were fine.  I watched a 10 minute video showing how to install a faucet on you tube.  Hardly a job worth $629.00!  I think the elderly should be very careful!

mrKnxIZAr4nv9-w2PwmqGg,1,"I had a jiffy lube coupon for a $20 oil change (from their website, not Groupon) so I figured I would try them out. First of all a regular priced oil change is approximately $44, which is astronomical considering my dealership only charges $30.  The coupon touted a number of ""free services"" provided with an oil change. I didn't get charged for any additional, but at least 2 of the services were poorly done or not done at all. On my receipt, it stated that cleaning exterior windows was done, but that was clearly not true considering the amount of bugs and dirt still on the windshield and other windows. Second, the windshield washer fluid was replaced with water. Finally, as soon as I leave my change oil light comes on.

OJs324V0kfqJMq-3G46x2Q,5,"Update-7/15/16 I wanted to take a moment and update my previous review. After writing the review below, and still experiencing similar results, I took my issues to the General Manager at Shooters World. I explained the situation, and my experiences, and he was genuinely interested in my input and I have received fantastic service ever since. So much so that I decided to purchase a membership, and am now a regular visitor. One thing to keep in mind going forward is that you will notice the prices on firearms here are a bit higher than most places. Shooters World does offer FFL transfers for online purchases, which is how I started purchasing my collection. But included in the slightly higher prices is the lifetime guarantee on what they sell. Not many places are willing to offer that, and in my opinion it is worth the extra charge. That said, my review is now going up from 3 stars to 5. Hope someone finds this helpful. 


As many others have stated in the reviews, the ranges are beautiful, as are the retail facilities. I have been to Shooters World dozens of times, and have made a handful of purchases. What I have personally noticed is a steady drop in real customer service. 

When the store first opened the staff was fantastic. Very knowledgeable, and great customer service. As time has gone on, the service has gotten worse and worse. During my last visit, on a VERY quiet weekday, early in the afternoon, I was in the area and decided to stop by to see what was in stock. I started in the tactical section as this is primarily my main shooting interest. Numerous employees about, and 2 other customers. I walked back and forth for over 20 minutes looking at the long guns. In this entire time my presence was not even recognized, much less was I asked if I needed any assistance. Their loss as I was ready to make a significant investment on a rifle. 

The other half of the store, aimed more at the general gun person, was a little better. Here I was eventually greeted by an employee, who genuinely seemed interested in helping me out. However the combination of my experience in the tactical section, as well as their very limited selection in a fairly standard caliber (.300 Win Mag), seriously made me consider spending money in an establishment that was once an outstanding experience. 

To Shooters World staff, learn what is important. You can have the nicest facility in the state, but you need to go back to the basics and train your employees better. If you need some help in learning customer service, I would be happy to share what I have learned in over 20 years of taking care of some of the pickiest customers. Including several of the founders of your company.",6UonO-a6CLDiLye-nrzTpw,3,"As many others have stated in the reviews, the ranges are beautiful, as are the retail facilities.

Ate one and started to eat the next but the remaining pieces were just fat and gristle. Complained to the server and was told the dinner would be taken off our bill but we had to pay for the sides. So how exactly did the ""sides"" almost cost as much as the dinner???? they took off $1.99. Bitched and they took off another 10%. Still NOT WORTH IT!!!.

4h2dX-SSQaEqNbYkrrV_Qg,5,"I called ahead to see if they had availability for walk ins today and John was so personable on the phone. From the phone convo to the time I walked out, everyone was kind, patient and didn't make me feel like a kindergartener with zero tattoo experience (even though I totally am). I entered the shop within an hour of talking to John on the phone and was greeted kindly. I showed John the text I wanted and some different fonts I liked for it and he suggested one of those that would work best. As is probably often the case with girls wanting little text tattoos in a foreign language (cliche, I know), John said the size I originally envisioned was too small for the tattoo to hold up well over time. Instead of just blowing up the text to the correct font size, he took about 10 minutes to hand draw the text in the font we picked so that he could bring the letters together a little more so it would appear a little smaller without compromising the clarity of the ink. 

I'm extremely picky and had him put the placement stencil on in literally seven different places--some varying by mere millimeters. He never once made me feel rushed or like I was being annoying, even though I'm sure I was super annoying. At one point, after John had already spent an hour with me drawing the text and putting the stencil on for the fifth time, he really sweetly said, ""and no worries if you feel hesitant. If you'd rather go home and think on it, you totally can."" He didn't say it in a way that implied he was frustrated with me and wanted me out of the shop--I could tell he genuinely just wanted me to be happy with it and have no doubts. Well on attempt #7, the stencil just FELT right going on my skin and I knew even before looking in the mirror that it was in the right spot. 

Finally, I got in the chair. I was super nervous--I wondered if I might faint or not be able to sit still or handle the pain, but I survived. I was really surprised--my tattoo is on the rib area but I didn't experience it as painful. It was just like a sensation that I guess I recognized should be called pain, but for some reason my mind didn't react to it and I actually was able to find enjoyment in the sensation. I don't have other tattoos so I don't know if this had to do with John's light touch or what, but I'm gonna go ahead and say it was that because I'm a huge baby about pain. 

I started out with my headphones in just to calm the nerves but after a few minutes I took them out and chatted with John and occasionally two other artists for the rest of the time. It was done in about 30 minutes. I was in the shop from 11:30 to 2:30 and actively taking up John's time (drawing, printing and reprinting stencils, changing the placement) so for all that time and work, I thought the price was very reasonable. I'm eager to go home and take my bandage off once the obligatory two hours has elapsed. Thank you John and everyone at Frequency!

k_59eWwtm9KlMYQjq96AUg,4,"A friend and I went there for brunch this morning and had a great time! It was kinda empty for a Sunday brunch which is odd. I love the Latin inspired menu and the fact that you can order half sizes of the richer entrees. We split a Cuban Toast and the Breakfast Tacos. I had never heard of breakfast tacos before so we were intrigued. They are each wrapped in 2 tortillas and generously filled with  an eggs, salsa, guac mixture. 
The Cuban toast had walnuts sprinkled on it and was great also. It's made in condensed milk and was rich and sweet. 
I also ordered a Cafe Olla which I loved! Id go back just for that coffee. It's a cafe with I think nutmeg, orange, and some spices and topped with whip cream. I didn't need to add any cream or sugar. It was pretty and different and tasted great. 
The service was very friendly and our waiter was helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations.

Update: came back using a groupon today but for take out. Wait staff was VERY nice. I could def see a change. Manager was super accommodating and really nice both over the phone and in person. All of the waiters were so friendly with my daughter while we waited in the front to order. Even the bartender was sweet and friendly (older guy- wish I would've caught his name). Crab and corn soup was fabulous and one of the best I've tasted, stuffed mushroom appetizer was overcooked and honestly tasted like nothing. Redfish dish was excellent just like last time and it looks like they lowered the price, bravo.  I could see myself coming back and hanging in the bar :)"

jLK0oIbGf3lbwTJ8geOi2Q,1,"I would give no stars if I could. I bought the Groupon to get 3 blowouts and thermal style and when my friend and I got there, it seemed ok. They have good products so I guess that 1 star can go to that. They lack in any skill, I don't think they even gave us real hairdressers. Our hair was horrible. We asked for curl and needed it to stay for a night wedding. Well before I even left the salon, my curls fell out. An hour later, my hair was stick straight, so the $45 I ended up spending, I had to go home and redo myself anyway. They were very unprofessional with poor customer service and really quite rude. I wish there was a way I could get my money back. I will absolutely not use the other blowouts I bought in the Groupon. I highly recommend NOT going to Tease Salon if you want quality service.

joyy0OxdQuoloJgAgT5DGA,3,"I put this review off for too long because I wasn't sure how I felt about it. This place Is called Earl's, but it isn't Earl's. And I guess this isn't a review so much as it is a comparison between this place, and the place that used to be here before the fire, which was called Earl's.
    We had lunch here last month, not long after they reopened and we were very excited because we loved the old place(5 stars for sure). The new décor inside is totally different from before. Not in a bad way, a lot of natural light, and the wood furniture has a light almost rustic look to it. The old place was a little more intimate, softer lighting, dark mahogany stained wood finishes. I guess the idea of having a more casual atmosphere for the reopening is supposed to help attract more people who haven't been to the old place but, I think the old Earl's felt a little classier, and for the money I'm spending, I don't want to be ""classy pretending to be casual"", I want the goods from the host at the front door to the mints on my way out.
    Two cocktails to start, and they were both very nice. Then salad, which was salad. I have to note here that we almost always get appetizers when we eat out because, well do I need a reason for appetizers? I like to try a lot of stuff so when I go out to eat, I eat a little bit when I get there before I eat while I'm there. Anyway no apps this time, why? There wasn't a great selection to choose from and none of them grabbed me. To be fair, it was lunch, and there are a few more choices for dinner but, even the two or three options I didn't have weren't calling out to me. My wife thinks I was expecting too much of the old place in the new menu. This might be somewhat true, they had some amazing appetizers before. I will never forget the first time I had there Portobello fries.Crispy beer batter on the outside, hot delicious Portobello on the inside, served in a ramekin full of garlic aioli, SO delicious. Any way we didn't have any of the ok looking apps this time.
    House made  fusilli with local wild mushrooms, spring asparagus, and roasted garlic in tomato sauce for her, house made pappardelle with Hudson valley duck confit, fiddle-head ferns, and mascarpone cheese for me. Both were well done, pappardelle was a little greasy but, its duck confit so, it's going to have some grease.
    I have no complaints. But I still feel like I didn't have the kind of experience that I was expecting. I knew it wasn't going to be exactly the same as it was before, but when a place is that good and they get a chance try something new, I want to be WOWED! This was more like ""meh, that was good"". Oh, I also read in another review for the new place that the service was slow and I agree. Good, but slow. I'm not sure if this is a totally fair review, being more of a comparison, and they are still new in a way.

   This time it was noticeable that my hair was curled & it held up pretty well. The stylist was very nice but seemed a bit inexperienced. Not used to having to give instructions or ask for product. I still had to do some tweaking before I could go out. 
   Also, little side note, I wish they would ask if you'd like something to drink after you're in the salon & seated at the hair station. Instead it was mentioned as I was walking thru the door but after I was washed & having my hair done is when I would've liked one!;)

XzjM-_Q3aUCe3SZc07gGWQ,4,"Looking for a little bar action to partake in? A must-try and FAVE of mine is none other than the M.L. Rose (formally Melrose Pub). Being that I'm in my late twenties (I'm holding on ya'll.. I turn 30 next week), my take on what I'm looking for from the bar world now is a bit different than when I was say, 21, and ML Rose perfectly encompasses what my friends and I enjoy most at our age: Lower-key atmosphere, has pretty people watching (don't lie, you like this too), a great patio, offers a good drink spesh or two, an awesome beer/drink selection, and of course, great service and food.

Let's break the deets down a bit further for your information:

Low Key: There will always be a steady stream of people here unless you go during the day when it tends to be a bit slower. If you're not in to bigger crowds, avoid the 2-4-1 nights where it tends to get a little crowded. Also, I've never witnessed a rowdy crowd here.

Pretty People Watching: Yep I said it. There are some good looking folk frequenting this local hot spot.

Great Patio: I love there is great outdoor patio space at both locations--even has a few fun games to get in to.

Drink Specials: 2-4-1 Thursday on 8th/ Wednesday on Charlotte. Happy hour M-F which includes $1 off liquor, wine, beers and apps. You can see all the specifics here.

Beer/Drinks: Fabulous craft beer selection that rotates seasonally, and they offer one of the best drinks in town: the Bushwacker, basically a Wendy's frosty for adults. 

Good Service/Food: The burgers are fab, and I love the nachos and BBQ wings too (BBQ wings are no longer on the menu, but you can still get them). Don't miss out on the waffle fries, sweet potato waffle fries, and the BEST RANCH DRESSING EVER. Trust. I've also consistently received great service, which is an absolute must!",Op88Ra5cl8-sjKTOTw8TIA,4,"Looking for a little bar action to partake in?

It was more out of the way, but with decent prices and a solid reputation, I thought I would be in good hands. So I took my car there today to see about a noise that was coming from the right rear of the car. It was my understanding that they would drive my car, hear the noise, and diagnose the problem. I also mentioned to them that I thought my brakes were starting to go bad so I'd like them to check those too. About 2 hours after dropping my car off, they called to tell me that my brakes needed to be done and the front rotors replaced and that is what was causing my noise. I was immediately taken aback, the noise was not coming from my front brakes / rotors. The lady was very dismissive with me on the phone when I questioned it, so I just decided to go and get my car. When I got there, the lady who had initially helped me was busy, one of the other guys said he would help me, but he couldn't find the paperwork and apparently couldn't look us up in the system. So we waited and waited and waited. Finally someone else offered to help he asked her for our paperwork and she snapped at him saying she was helping someone else. He then offered to look and see if he could get it in the system. She walked over and interrupted him which forced my husband to blurt out ""can we just get the keys to the car?"". Here's the kicker... My keys were in the ignition, windows completely rolled down, parked unoccupied in front of the dealership for anyone to just take.

They didn't even take the tires off to look at the brakes. They didn't do anything! And they wanted to charge me $50 for a diagnostic fee! I'm completely appalled by the unprofessional service demonstrated today and the blatant lack of supervision my car received while in their care.

G4iABuTV5-6_P3Q9qH1qlg,3,"Have been here twice because my hubby saw a great deal online for a season membership. Honestly, the place is not horrible but just too far away for us (2hr ride). We have a toddler who LOVES the kiddie section which is tiny (infant to age 4/5) I have never been on the big slides so I can't comment in them. The lazy river, which I usually love, has a dirty feel and smell to it. 

The outside, when hot, is actually a nice surprise. They have a dj that plays cool music by the bar. (I have only been there on wknds therefore not sure how often DJ is there) the outside has a very cute and pretty cool kiddie section (probably for up to age 4/5).
The outside also includes a big wave pool.

Overall I think it worth it if you have kids from toddler- about early teens, older would probably get bored. Try it if you don't have to travel too far. Arrive nice and early for close parking and no lines for entry. 

Oh they also have a small arcade indoors which again is cool for the ages I mentioned.

The kids love coming here as well. The Phanatic is a fun mascot to watch and there is a great kids play area all decked out with the Philly Phanatic. This fun zone has slides and tunnels to keep the kids occupied. It can and does get pretty crazy in there with all of the kids and it's pretty easy to lose your kids in all of those tunnels. There is only one way in and out of this place, so I usually park by butt by this area and make sure they don't get out. There are plenty of workers in the area and I'm sure they are making sure kids aren't walking out by themselves as well.

Plenty of food and drink options throughout the park and even places geared for kids where you can get them milk and child size portions. Plenty of shopping areas throughout the park as well. My kids always want to stop in and buy something, so I'm not sure if I really consider this a good thing or not!

While we always do have a good time, I will say it can be pretty expensive. You start off with $15 to park, then factor in tickets, food, drinks, possible souvenirs, and the next thing you know, you've dropped several hundred bucks! Given the way the Phillies are playing this year, it's a bit frustrating. Getting out of this place is usually a royal pain in the you know what as well!

VqOcttguNP4a76zleAV9zQ,4,"8/25 Update: I gave Milk & Honey another chance and I'm glad I did. All the food was super fresh and tasty, the service was great, and the drinks were good too. We started with the bread plate (which was awesome, and apparently very popular because I saw like 6 other ones come out), and then I had the Mediterranean Veggies which was a ton of great food. I also enjoyed a horchata latte... very good! If you're in the Gulch it's worth checking out. 

------

Walked into Milk & Honey on Saturday, 3/24 around 1:30pm and asked what the wait time was for a table of 2. The hostess indicated it'd be about an hour and a half wait. I said ""ok, thank you, I think we'll go look somewhere else"" to which the hostess felt it necessary to reply ""have fun! Maybe try Applebee's"" in an incredibly condescending tone. 

Curious whether it's just the hostess that believes being rude to customers is acceptable, or if it's standard practice at this restaurant. With all the fantastic food options available in Nashville, I don't think I'll be coming back her",g_4t0YPHvp0smjuLUGWl8g,1,"Walked into Milk & Honey on Saturday, 3/24 around 1:30pm and asked what the wait time was for a table of 2.

I have no problem paying for quality--but this place offers none. The entire staff is rude, the only niceties exchanged where when it very clearly occurred to them halfway through my service that a tip was involved. It was just forced and resentful ""you live around here stuff"" which also just felt like they were trying to suss out if I would be a return customer or not. The woman who did my gel manicure was the salon manager, and if she doesn't even do a good job, how can you expect her employees to. She baked the gel polish onto the outside of my nails/skin, so only four days into my manicure it started to peel off. She also filed my nails completely at an angle, and was annoyed when I asked her to straighten them out. The young woman who did my pedicure was a complete sweetheart and did a great job, so at least there's that--but she was an exception as I noticed the rest of the staff was also surly and doing shoddy work that clients were asking be corrected. The atmosphere is nice, but that's pretty much the only thing this place has going for it. I don't want to rip a business apart, but I just hate how nails salons are so hit or miss.

Last Saturday (8/4/18) evening we arrived for dinner, two adults and an infant. It was very warm inside and most patrons were fanning themselves with their menus. We ordered the bread plate appetizer, carne asada and braised short rib with gnocchi. The food all had great flavor as we share everything we order. However, The gnocchi were still cold and way undercooked. Having filled up on the bread plate I didn't complain I just didn't continue eating the dinner entree. Fast forward to the next afternoon, when both adults became violently ill. I ended up in the hospital with testing results positive for salmonella poisoning. 

Not saying it was or was not M&H, but everything lines up. Be careful. No matter where you eat. Be careful. 

Update: I have had several other Yelp reviewers message me individually to confirm they had the same meal and also contracted salmonella. It's clearly not a fluke when no less than 12 people get salmonella on the same day.

Op88Ra5cl8-sjKTOTw8TIA,4,"Looking for a little bar action to partake in? A must-try and FAVE of mine is none other than the M.L. Rose (formally Melrose Pub). Being that I'm in my late twenties (I'm holding on ya'll.. I turn 30 next week), my take on what I'm looking for from the bar world now is a bit different than when I was say, 21, and ML Rose perfectly encompasses what my friends and I enjoy most at our age: Lower-key atmosphere, has pretty people watching (don't lie, you like this too), a great patio, offers a good drink spesh or two, an awesome beer/drink selection, and of course, great service and food.

Let's break the deets down a bit further for your information:

Low Key: There will always be a steady stream of people here unless you go during the day when it tends to be a bit slower. If you're not in to bigger crowds, avoid the 2-4-1 nights where it tends to get a little crowded. Also, I've never witnessed a rowdy crowd here.

Pretty People Watching: Yep I said it. There are some good looking folk frequenting this local hot spot.

Great Patio: I love there is great outdoor patio space at both locations--even has a few fun games to get in to.

Drink Specials: 2-4-1 Thursday on 8th/ Wednesday on Charlotte. Happy hour M-F which includes $1 off liquor, wine, beers and apps. You can see all the specifics here.

Beer/Drinks: Fabulous craft beer selection that rotates seasonally, and they offer one of the best drinks in town: the Bushwacker, basically a Wendy's frosty for adults. 

Good Service/Food: The burgers are fab, and I love the nachos and BBQ wings too (BBQ wings are no longer on the menu, but you can still get them). Don't miss out on the waffle fries, sweet potato waffle fries, and the BEST RANCH DRESSING EVER. Trust.

We also ordered the Fried Chicken Liver because I love liver and onions over rice, a dish I grew up eating so I was excited to try it, although was ultimately disappointed. It didn't have seasoning and it was heavy on the batter, although ""fluffy"" if that makes sense. They serve it with a hot and sweet jelly which compliments the liver well. I just wasn't too crazy about the overall bland taste and it tasted grimy. 
Then we had the fried chicken with the potato salad and collard greens as sides. The potato salad isn't bad. I guess the locals make it with lots of mustard instead of mayo. Fried chicken is fried chicken, the batter was different and the chicken was moist. My biggest disappointment was the collard greens, it has no flavor. It's basically boiled with a little bit of pepper. Again, it must just be the way they cook it here. It seems some foods are bland as hell whereas others are bursting with flavor.

She made it a priority to speak with all of the customers. The food here is definitely too notch. My only criticism is that our food was slow coming out. Our server was nice enough to inform us that an appetizer was not going to be ready until near when our entrees would be so we just cancelled it. Overall a great experience and worth the try. 
Came back again and got the Fries and Wings and they came right out! Love the people and love the food."

When we showed up to check in the front desk told us only one room was ready the other connecting room was being cleaned. He went ahead & charged my card for both rooms & told me they would call once the other was ready. 2 hours later we got the call & returned to the front desk the gal at the front desk began to tell me that we only had one room & argued with me about having a second room I explained to her that I was told the room number & everything. She still questioned me as though I was not being truthful so I had to point out the gentleman who checked me in just to confirm my story only to find out the whole problem really was that someone gave our other room away!

L-yIlLicBBXaKM6b_VqfOg,2,"The store was more than willing to take my money for the deposit to order the furniture. The store personnel didn't seem to think I needed to be told that (1) my order was in; and (2) that payment needed to be made in full before they could even schedule delivery of my furniture. I had to call them to find out where my order was and ask if it was available for delivery. 
When the delivery was initially scheduled , the rug pads for my rug and runner were not available. When I got the call to let me know what time frame to expect the delivery, i was told both pads were in and would be delivered. The morning of the delivery, I got a call from their warehouse that only one pad would be delivered as the other was lost. And when the furniture was delivered there were NO RUG PADS AT ALL. Their warehouse managed to lose BOTH pads. And the rug we ordered was a full foot shorter than what we ordered. We ordered an  8x11 rug; we received an 8x10 rug. The designer who came out to our house showed us the manufacturer spec sheet that shows the rug at 8x10 and the store spec sheet showing the rug measurement of 8x11...apparently the dimension was entered incorrectly at the corporate level. I have requested a pro-rated refund, of about 9%, as I did not get the rug I ordered and paid for-I got a rug a full foot shorter than my order. I have heard nothing yet about that   
One  of my chairs has a squeak, that is getting worse by the day and won't be repaired for another two weeks. 
The store refunded the delivery charge in a timely manner for the inconvenience of the missing rug pads.; that was last Wednesday.I did receive a voicemail from the designer on Monday, and I was not able to call the until today. The voicemail said nothing about the pads being found.

***Update*** I received the  pad for the runner this morning, 4/14. The area rug pad was supposed to be delivered today as well. When I called the store to advise the pad was not delivered, I was told the sales rep would look into why it was not delivered and call me back; i called at about 1:15 this afternoon and as of now, 5:00, i have had no word.. I also inquired about the pro-rata refund for the part of the rug that I paid for but didn't receive. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the order was placed for an 8x10 area not 8x11. I will be taking my paperwork to the store so this sales rep can see for herself that she did order an 8x11 rug and that she did NOT order an 8x10 rug. I do not appreciate being told I am wrong, or a liar, when I know i am correct and the sales rep is wrong. 
It is frustrating that the cheapest items in my order are the ones giving me the headaches."

We started with the Spinach and Artichoke dip with chips, it arrived promptly and hot, It was good, about average when it comes to this appetizer that has become mainstream menu option.

After looking over the large amount of menu options and combinations , I decided I would go with her recommendation of the Porterhouse. I ordered mine medium with a baked potato and "" walkabout soup"".  The soup came first and it was good and different nothing great but different in a good way. Our steaks arrived hot and a generous portion , both cooked as per our request. I would have to admit it was good, a bit pricey 25.00 but it was good. Of course we are not talking Berns,Mortons or my local fav Peter Lugers in Brooklyn but for Outback it was a good steak.

They have good products so I guess that 1 star can go to that. They lack in any skill, I don't think they even gave us real hairdressers. Our hair was horrible. We asked for curl and needed it to stay for a night wedding. Well before I even left the salon, my curls fell out. An hour later, my hair was stick straight, so the $45 I ended up spending, I had to go home and redo myself anyway. They were very unprofessional with poor customer service and really quite rude. I wish there was a way I could get my money back. I will absolutely not use the other blowouts I bought in the Groupon.

***Update: I was privately messaged by the salon owner to take down my review and she would return my money, which I agreed to. I set up a date to come by the salon, and NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN. Worst business owners ever. Do not go to this salon. They do not stick to their word and they sure as anything don't know how to do hair."

NsgcgjR212M4NHwiEwIjOw,1,"My wife and I always use Hooters as our fall back restaurant because our kids love good chicken, and, their new expanded menu gives us so many more choices. This past Sunday, 10/31/16, we again found ourselves at Tyrone Hooters, my daughter ordered a buffalo chicken salad, son ordered boneless bbq wings, wife ordered tilapia salad, and I ordered the grouper sandwich. It was around 4 pm, so the restaurant wasn't that busy. Being we live on the Gulfcoast, my wife and I eat a good amount of seafood. When served, all dinners looked great...except the tilapia salad. Here was this huge bowl of salad with a tiny piece of fish on top...less than one ounce. Now, my grouper sandwich was $15, I had, at least, a six ounce piece of fish, if not larger. My wife was paying $10 for this salad. Living here in St. Pete...EVERYONE knows tilapia is one of the most inexpensive cuts of fish in the industry.  We asked the waitress if something could be done, she came back and said the Manager would be over soon. After a 17 minute wait, no Manager, but a second piece of identical size of cooked tilapia on a plate by itself. It was ridiculous to wait any longer for my wife to start eating, besides, the rest of us were almost done by now. When we got the check, on the bottom of it, it said ""Extra Meat Charge"" $7.99 Tilapia. The next line, it was charged off.  Here's what I've deducted using my hospitality experience:

1. If this is a corporate decision or procedure, guess what, Publix has one pound bags of tilapia on sale for $9.99...6-7 whole filet portions...PUBLIX!!!!!

2. Why would any experienced server look at that salad, seeing other seafood being served, and not question what she's looking at?????

3. If a server went to a ""Manager"" about the problem, and no Manager addressed the problem with the customer, did the server lie? Did the Manager choose not to engage the customer????

Had to end up taking the car back because the noise didn't stop. The original noise did, but it created a new one. Dobbs got to the bottom of it and made sure it was fixed. I can't high five then enough right now for fixing it and making things right. We're all probably hoping it doesn't come back! But all is good for now!!
I will definitely go to Dobbs again!


UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW. 

Spoke with management and it's going to be sorted out. Dobbs is going above and beyond. Kudos to them for actually listening to customers. 


Took the car in to have the brakes/calipers/rotors and a noise checked. Dropped off the night before and they called by 8:30 the next morning to say they couldn't hear anything and everything was fine. FANTASTIC!... Or so I thought. Picked the car up that evening and within 5 minutes of leaving, the noise started back up. It was rush our traffic, so I didn't turn around. Noise got louder the following day. I decided to jack the car up and see for myself. After pinpointing the noise to the rear wheel, noticed the caliper was sticking and the brakes were very dirty. I also noticed that the week/brakes hadn't been take off or inspected. I basically paid $31 for someone to drive my car, to literally just ""look"" (they must've looked from across the parking lot) and ""not hear"" anything. You'd have to be deaf not to hear the noise. 
I really wanted to like this place. The staff was friendly and prompt and the hours are a great convenience for people that work day hours. But the service was subpar and I feel like I was just a case of ""making a quick buck"". Unfortunately for them, I'm not ""dumb"" when it comes to cars.

When the store first opened the staff was fantastic. Very knowledgeable, and great customer service. As time has gone on, the service has gotten worse and worse. During my last visit, on a VERY quiet weekday, early in the afternoon, I was in the area and decided to stop by to see what was in stock. I started in the tactical section as this is primarily my main shooting interest. Numerous employees about, and 2 other customers. I walked back and forth for over 20 minutes looking at the long guns. In this entire time my presence was not even recognized, much less was I asked if I needed any assistance. Their loss as I was ready to make a significant investment on a rifle. 

The other half of the store, aimed more at the general gun person, was a little better. Here I was eventually greeted by an employee, who genuinely seemed interested in helping me out. However the combination of my experience in the tactical section, as well as their very limited selection in a fairly standard caliber (.300 Win Mag), seriously made me consider spending money in an establishment that was once an outstanding experience. 

To Shooters World staff, learn what is important. You can have the nicest facility in the state, but you need to go back to the basics and train your employees better.

After writing the review below, and still experiencing similar results, I took my issues to the General Manager at Shooters World. I explained the situation, and my experiences, and he was genuinely interested in my input and I have received fantastic service ever since. So much so that I decided to purchase a membership, and am now a regular visitor. One thing to keep in mind going forward is that you will notice the prices on firearms here are a bit higher than most places. Shooters World does offer FFL transfers for online purchases, which is how I started purchasing my collection. But included in the slightly higher prices is the lifetime guarantee on what they sell. Not many places are willing to offer that, and in my opinion it is worth the extra charge. That said, my review is now going up from 3 stars to 5. Hope someone finds this helpful.

QzWc2OfMrwTp0m5E8rHEuw,1,"The first time I ordered here I was quite impressed with how good their French Dip was and their fries were salty perfection! The online ordering went smooth, although their website is not up to date & as basic as you can get. Delivery was within 30 minutes so I was happy with that.

The reason I am only giving one stars is because the second time I ordered, I ordered the same thing except when I got it my fries were ice cold not just room temperature but ice cold, and my sandwich was covered with Swiss cheese. Everybody knows a French dip does not have cheese on it nor did it have it on it just two days ago when I ordered from this place for the first time. So I called to let them know that they gave me the wrong sandwich and a lady proceeded to argue with me and tell me all their French dips come with Swiss cheese. I told her that they didn't in the past and if she would take a moment and look on her website that it does not say Swiss cheese. She proceeded to raise her voice and argue with me, then finally said ""what do you want me to do about it?"" All snotty. When I told her well obviously I would like the sandwiches that I paid for I do not like Swiss cheese I do not want any cheese I want what I ordered, she hung up on me. So I called the delivery driver and let them know I want the sandwich that I ordered. An hour later the very nice delivery driver delivered my sandwich with many apologies. She really was so nice at that point I had forgiven everything and we just wanted to eat I was absolutely ravenous and took a big bite out of my sandwich almost inhaling it. There was something crunchy in it which I thought a bit odd but figured maybe it was an onion that didn't cook all the way and at that point I didn't care I was starving but by the time I finished chewing and swallowed it my mouth was on absolute fire and I could feel a slow burn in the pit of my stomach. Within seconds I could taste jalapeno. So I called back after searching through the rest of the sandwich and finding One very small piece of jalapeno left. It was pretty obvious to me that the girl who is pissy on the phone thought she'd be cute by sticking a jalapeno in my sandwich. There was only one in the whole sandwich unfortunately I got most of it in the first bite. The manager proceeded to tell me his employees wouldn't give me something like that and that his sandwiches are quality check before going out. Hmm really??? Then how did the first sandwich get out of the place wrong? And how come my stomach is still burning it now or later? (I can't eat jalapenos anymore due to an ulcer) so basically my stomach is in pain and I can't eat. He then proceeded to tell me how he's been in business 10 years and he knows what he's doing... Yada yada yada. 

I am really disappointed as this was going to be one of my favorite lunch places as I eat out quite often for lunch and I really try to support local businesses but there is no way I will ever order from here again. $15 per sandwich, small fry and a 12 ounce soda is ridiculous to have to throw away. 

I would've been quite willing to try the place again and was quite willing to leave a good review as mistakes happen but the attitude by the employee, hanging up on me, and the managers total indifference to his customers has left more than just A bad taste and burn in my mouth.... Obviously he's not looking to stay in business as he does not care about his customers.

Within seconds I could taste jalapeno. So I called back after searching through the rest of the sandwich and finding One very small piece of jalapeno left. It was pretty obvious to me that the girl who is pissy on the phone thought she'd be cute by sticking a jalapeno in my sandwich. There was only one in the whole sandwich unfortunately I got most of it in the first bite. The manager proceeded to tell me his employees wouldn't give me something like that and that his sandwiches are quality check before going out. Hmm really??? Then how did the first sandwich get out of the place wrong? And how come my stomach is still burning it now or later? (I can't eat jalapenos anymore due to an ulcer) so basically my stomach is in pain and I can't eat. He then proceeded to tell me how he's been in business 10 years and he knows what he's doing... Yada yada yada. 

I am really disappointed as this was going to be one of my favorite lunch places and I really try to support local businesses but there is no way I will ever order from here again. $15 per sandwich, small fry and a 12 ounce soda is ridiculous to have to throw away. 

I would've been quite willing to try the place again and was quite willing to leave a good review as mistakes happen but the attitude by the employee, hanging up on me, and the managers total indifference to his customers has left more than just A bad taste and burn in my mouth.... Obviously he's not looking to stay in business as he does not care about his customers."

rOn5YEb0BHk6WBgZfhbryQ,1,"Unfortunately this was not a good stay. It's unfortunate for the amount of money we dumped into one night. 
So we started off with being assigned a room. Went into the assigned room and it was a mess. Not cleaned up at all. 
Went back downstairs to get a new room, and then proceeded to the new room. Upon arrival in the new room, wasn't clean either. Really looked as if someone made the bed (hopefully clean sheets) and folded the towels. Looked down at the floor and there was hair everywhere. Hair from the head and hair from other places as well. 
Smell in the room was not appetizing at all either. 
The cleaning ladies (both floors that we went to) were on their phones hanging out in the room at the end of the hallway. I know why the rooms weren't clean. 
For a room this size, and lack of cleanliness, I could have easily stayed at motel 6 and received better service. 
Very disappointed. Getting in contact with AAA also to let them know since this is an advertised hotel on their site. I trust AAA and they probably have no idea.

I parked the up in the boxes and bag they came in and had the receipt and went back to the  King Of Prussia boutique to return or even exchange them since I could not use them. I talked to a gal who smirked and pulled my receipt out of my bad and rudely pointed to the return policy at the bottom which stated you cannot return any used product. I had no idea! Was not informed of that policy at all! Would never have purchased skin products with my sensitivities and reactions knowing that I couldn't return something if it didn't work for me.

xKVghkQi4ECK8Sf0Qqki7g,1,"The store was more than willing to take my money for the deposit to order the furniture. The store personnel didn't seem to think I needed to be told that (1) my order was in; and (2) that payment needed to be made in full before they could even schedule delivery of my furniture. I had to call them to find out where my order was and ask if it was available for delivery. 
When the delivery was initially scheduled , the rug pads for my rug and runner were not available. When I got the call to let me know what time frame to expect the delivery, i was told both pads were in and would be delivered. The morning of the delivery, I got a call from their warehouse that only one pad would be delivered as the other was lost. And when the furniture was delivered there were NO RUG PADS AT ALL. Their warehouse managed to lose BOTH pads. And the rug we ordered was a full foot shorter than what we ordered. We ordered an  8x11 rug; we received an 8x10 rug. The designer who came out to our house brought us the manufacturer spec sheet that shows the rug at 8x10 and the store spec sheet showing the rug measurement of 8x11...apparently the dimension was entered incorrectly at the corporate level. I have requested a pro-rated refund, of about 9%, as I did not get the rug I ordered and paid for-I got a rug a full foot shorter than my order. I have heard nothing yet about that   
One  of my chairs has a squeak, that is getting worse by the day and won't be repaired for another two weeks. 
The store refunded the delivery charge in a timely manner for the inconvenience of the missing rug pads.; that was last Wednesday.I did receive a voicemail from the designer on Monday, and I was not able to call the until today. The voicemail said nothing about the pads being found.
The delivery people were great, very careful, polite, and quick. I am very disappointed with the store people and their lack of timely repair services and communications. 
***Update*** I received the  pad for the runner this morning, 4/14. The area rug pad was supposed to be delivered today as well. When I called the store to advise the pad was not delivered, I was told the sales rep would look into why it was not delivered and call me back; i called at about 1:15 this afternoon and as of now, 5:00, i have had no word.. I also inquired about the pro-rata refund for the part of the rug that I paid for but didn't receive. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the order was placed for an 8x10 area not 8x11. I will be taking my paperwork to the store so this sales rep can see for herself that she did order an 8x11 rug and that she did NOT order an 8x10 rug. I do not appreciate being told I am wrong, or a liar, when I know i am correct and the sales rep is wrong. 
It is frustrating that the cheapest items in my order are the ones giving me the headaches. 
May , 3, 2017 update:
I did visit the store in April to show the sales rep-Abby- that she indeed ordered an 8x11 area rug as evidenced by every single set of order papers I have. She insisted that the rug was ordered correctly as 8x10...repeatedly telling me i did not understand. Seeing that no further headway was possible with Abby regarding the misleading and false info on my paperwork I then inquired about the missing area rug pad. She said she finally got an answer from their warehouse in response to her email. Apparently the pad had been lost AGAIN. 
Imagine my surprise when we installed the runner pad and it was two full feel SHORT. . When I went to the store about the very short pad i was told abby would order it and call me the following Saturday to confirm it was ordered. No surprise here, she never called to confirm that order.
I waited a full week for her to call. Finally I emailed their ""comfort care"" email address detailing my list of problems with my order. Lindsey emailed me back, apologizing for the hassles I have had with this order, and offered to refund the cost of the arm/headrest ""napkins"" at $111.30 for the inconveniences. So far so good then Lindsey advised that she could not handle rug/ pad issues. I called first and spoke to Chuck about my frustrations most notably that his sales woman sold us something that does not exist and that I wanted a 9% refund on the area rug, totaling $57.24. They are ordering a new larger runner pad at no cost to me. 
Very long incomplete story short, they are refusing to refund 9% of the sales price for the missing foot of area rug and I still don't have the proper size runner pad nor the area rug pad. I am very dissatisfied with their ""customer service"" at the store level. If i could i would give them ZERO STARS. It's a shame because I really like my furniture. Dallas the store manager has NO interest in seeing us satisfied all over $57.24and seems he can ignore corporate directives at will. All I can say is-double/triple/quadruple check your order before paying one cent, don't believe any of the info in writing and question everything the sales rep tells you.",2Ir8hTnfQqYlNLierC-oyg,1,"The store was more than willing to take my money for the deposit to order the furniture.

gM9oq5oBKTXrWFy4uUcWiA,1,"After reading the positive reviews on here, I decided to give Sam's a try.  We arrived shortly after 5 PM on a weekday, so we were the only people in the restaurant until the over 65 crowd started arriving.  The decor is interesting - light colored wood slats cover the walls up to the high ceilings and somewhat mismatched booths and tables below.  It is almost reminiscent of a ski lodge, albeit one with the tables a little too close together.

We were promptly greeted, seated, ordered our drinks (their fresh-brewed ice tea) and began to browse the sparse menu.  If you don't want a burger or some grilled chicken concoction, this place is likely not for you.  We ordered the Thanksgiving on a ""French"" roll (no sides included, I ordered onion rings) and the walnut chicken with fries, applesauce and some strange-looking honey dip with pepper flakes (it tasted a bit better than it looked).

Our food arrived ~15 mins later as other diners gradually began to fill the establishment.  We were fortunate enough to choose one of the few tables that had ketchup and as I began to create a pool on my plate, I noticed this bottle had seen better days.   In fact, all of the ketchup bottles out had - the labels were oddly faded in a way that suggested these bottles had been ""washed"" and re-filled.  Come to think of it, the ketchup didn't taste like Heinz either.  Give me a break.

It got better, my soft roll was crusty on the edges from being cut and left to sit around, the turkey dry (which is supposedly roasted on site) and the stuffing bland.  The only redeeming quality of my meal was the cranberry sauce and the pre-packaged onion rings.

The walnut chicken seemed like a good idea, but also lacked flavor and the mountain of shoestring fries were not evenly seasoned with what appeared to be a ""Cajun"" seasoning.  The clear pepper flake laced jelly on the side did not look appetizing, tasted ok, but could do little to salvage this meal.

Overall, we could have easily made a better meal at home for less money - the bill came to $33 with tip.  There is a simple lack of quality and attention to detail.  It is obvious they get their weekly order from the restaurant supplier, put things together with as little effort as possible and call it a ""grill joint"".  If you are in the area, you'd do better with the Applebee's or the Subway across the street.  Even better yet, fire up the grill at home - you can't do any worse.",5AUk2ITwhnsZ2ZvQTP0Y2A,1,"After reading the positive reviews on here, I decided to give Sam's a try.

I'm a fan of all their tacos. They are always generously stuffed with meat, however their  horchata (rice drink) is horrible. It tastes like water with some bland powder. Their horchata is not authentic at all. Would have been great with the tacos however they go great with a beer or coke. Delivery is generally fast and friendly. Some of the females answering the phone seem immature which make it difficult to place a phone order because they seem absent minded and laugh just about every other word because they can't pronounce items on the menu and don't even know their menu. It helped I had a menu and had to speak slowly to the lady and repeat it numerous times. It was annoying, but the food was worth it. Delivery is only $1 which is great.

q2OFO0HkIvMdzSIWqiVMeA,4,"We've been to a number of Phillies games over the year and really like this ballpark. We've sat all over this park and we've never had a bad seat. Sure lower levels are better, but even up in the 400 level isn't that bad. We really enjoy sitting in the Hall of Fame club and of course the suites, but I only go to these areas when I get free tickets! 

The kids love coming here as well. The Phanatic is a fun mascot to watch and there is a great kids play area all decked out with the Philly Phanatic. This fun zone has slides and tunnels to keep the kids occupied. It can and does get pretty crazy in there with all of the kids and it's pretty easy to lose your kids in all of those tunnels. There is only one way in and out of this place, so I usually park by butt by this area and make sure they don't get out. There are plenty of workers in the area and I'm sure they are making sure kids aren't walking out by themselves as well. 

Plenty of food and drink options throughout the park and even places geared for kids where you can get them milk and child size portions. Plenty of shopping areas throughout the park as well. My kids always want to stop in and buy something, so I'm not sure if I really consider this a good thing or not!

While we always do have a good time, I will say it can be pretty expensive. You start off with $15 to park, then factor in tickets, food, drinks, possible souvenirs, and the next thing you know, you've dropped several hundred bucks! Given the way the Phillies are playing this year, it's a bit frustrating. Getting out of this place is usually a royal pain in the you know what as well! Would definitely recommend going to one of their fireworks games in July--they really do put on a spectacular fireworks show.

Had to end up taking the car back because the noise didn't stop. The original noise did, but it created a new one. Dobbs got to the bottom of it and made sure it was fixed. I can't high five then enough right now for fixing it and making things right. We're all probably hoping it doesn't come back! But all is good for now!!
I will definitely go to Dobbs again!


UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW. 

Spoke with management and it's going to be sorted out. Dobbs is going above and beyond. Kudos to them for actually listening to customers.

They provide good family friendly service at this location. Ms. Marie who works there during the days provides some of the kindest customer service I've ever experienced. She always checks on my kidos and I do see how we're doing. The play area can get a little hectic because many parents don't surpervise their kids.

Issue is with transportation to and from.  We were a group of six with one being 90 years old. We picked this company because they pick up and return ""direct"" to your hotel.  Long story short, they used a commercial size large bus to transport us to the tour. Driver was scary and hit road lane bumps as he talked to his cohort consistently. When you have a hundred people in your care you should have exemplary attention to your driving. I was not only passenger concerned. We were dropped off 3 blocks from hotel with our 90 year old left to walk with his cane in the heat. We were told bus too big to get to hotels and Driver didn't care or even try to call for help.

2nrA4SzsZ53fOzwpTQFZ8g,4,"Mother's Day brunch. Made reservations so all good.  Friendly greeting and they showed us right to our table.  Steak and eggs, pancakes, omelet.  All very very good.  The food here really is excellent.  Weekend Bloody Mary bar, smaller than others but still. Nice for the price and they have different mixes of spiciness.  Outstanding coffee , as always. 

The problem is the service.  Our server was Lauren who is absolutely in the wrong job for her skills. It I think this may be the height of her capabilities.  No silverware on the table.  She didn't notice and I had to get up and ask for it.  She had no intuitive abilities as to what should normally accompany food items.  Her demeanor and personality were also very flat. Almost a forced cordiality because she was being forced to serve us.  What would otherwise be a fantastic five star meal was made uncomfortable by her incompetence as a server.  I really wish Blondie's would pay attention to the job their servers are doing.  So much about this place I like.  But the service is literally there worst on Wash Ave. we may give them another try, just so many other options that we can walk to.  

Update:  based on several messages from neighbors who frequent this place, I think we may have had a one-off experience. We will give it another try. 

Further update: we've been back several times and both the service and food have been excellent.  We've recently moved to a plant-based diet and they are very accommodating with the menu. Particularly like the black bean burger (no cheese) and the juju veggie sandwich.  The fruit side is a nice option",TfPfMUAEI89FekvK9fEh1A,2,"Mother's Day brunch. Made reservations so all good.

I got home and the salad did not have the extra grilled onions, and all the other ingredients in the salad were skimpy.  They didn't shake the Greek dressing before filling the togo dressing cups, so mine was straight oil.  The worst part was my soup (which mind you is usually my favorite).  There was not ONE piece of orzo in it.  It was an entire container of shredded chicken and a small amount of broth.  You could hardly see the broth because there was so much chicken.  It was definitely the bottom of the soup pot.  I wish they would have told me they were running out of soup and I wouldn't have ordered it.

I'm very upset I need to pay $10 every time I go there for parking.. it used to be free and it should be free, for a place like that, that profits really nicely... it should definitely be complementary.
I understand that now they have construction expenses, but that will also bring more people and the casino will keep profiting even more than before.
If not a complimentary parking for all, at least for locals!
Besides that, the casino is awesome, clean, professional, and lots of fun!

I love the Latin inspired menu and the fact that you can order half sizes of the richer entrees. We split a Cuban Toast and the Breakfast Tacos. I had never heard of breakfast tacos before so we were intrigued. They are each wrapped in 2 tortillas and generously filled with  an eggs, salsa, guac mixture. 
The Cuban toast had walnuts sprinkled on it and was great also. It's made in condensed milk and was rich and sweet. 
I also ordered a Cafe Olla which I loved! Id go back just for that coffee. It's a cafe with I think nutmeg, orange, and some spices and topped with whip cream. I didn't need to add any cream or sugar. It was pretty and different and tasted great. 
The service was very friendly and our waiter was helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. I would def recommend this place and will be back with the husband!

16PvoxjsF8Zj8Aymwi5TNQ,2,"Updated 10/4. Had to remove a star because I emailed Morgan (who responded and asked me to contact her) over three weeks ago and haven't heard back. I wasn't looking for a free meal, but I would rather not have taken the time to contact GG if no one planned to respond. Also, I was in the restaurant yesterday and once again saw two issues: an older man (may have been the owner) overcharged a couple for a smoothie, and there was a discussion at the table next to mine about it (he did refund the extra amount). Also, one of the employees knocked a stack of about 20 empty boxes (that all meals are served in) on the floor and picked them up and continued to put food in them. I guess only the sides and top hit the floor, but still - seems like they should've been tossed. Wanted to like GG so badly, but I've literally never been when there isn't some kind of issue! 

I've been there at least 6 times since June, and I *really* want this to be a 5-star review! I love the menu, the focus on healthy and high quality ingredients, and the number of options available to someone with a dairy allergy. Unfortunately, I don't think I've had a single visit without a glitch, including today. These include: 

*the manager (female) carrying washed cucumbers ready to be diced with her bare hands, no gloves (today)
*taking 15 min to make my meal (grain bowl) after I paid, even though there was only one other customer (today)
*a new and obviously stressed employee needing the manager's help to answer a phone question - finally the manager took the phone, was kind to the customer on the other end, but then was clearly and vocally annoyed with the phone customer after hanging up. I get it, but prob better not to do in front of another customer - me - waiting to order (today)
*finding a pumpkin bar (delicious!!) in the case in August with a June expiration date. 
*realizing my last trip before today that none of the bars have exp dates anymore, which is odd as they all used to and the packaging hasn't changed? Worried they may have removed the dates because they aren't moving them quickly enough?
*out of quinoa noodles one visit even though I came for lunch 
*getting chicken for the first time recently and it was the consistency of feta cheese? I even initially thought they got my order wrong and put cheese on it. It was just tiny pieces of chicken that kind of fell apart as you ate. Very different from some pics on here. (Did NOT get sick though)
*avocado left off one order, realized when I got home (no big deal)

They were amazing as always and we had the rack of lamb and again, tasty as ever. The only negative is the drinks are quite pricy, but- when in Rome. The atmosphere and professional service makes up for the prices. It's one of my favorite spots for beef and a great meal with amazing service."

rHqS6TT62IhcFbrY4hHcVw,1,"I had an awful experience at the KOP Makeup Forever Boutique last Friday night. I went there because my esthetician friend told me that it would be the best makeup for my very sensitive, reactive skin. I have a chronic illness and have to take medicine that causes this. She told me that the boutique in King of Prussia was the best place to go for the most knowledgable help. I had a great experience, explained my issues and ended up purchasing 2 products. Low and behold, I broke out terribly after trying to use them for over a week. I parked the up in the boxes and bag they came in and had the receipt and went back to the  King Of Prussia boutique to return or even exchange them since I could not use them. I talked to a gal who smirked and pulled my receipt out of my bad and rudely pointed to the return policy at the bottom which stated you cannot return any used product. I had no idea! Was not informed of that policy at all! Would never have purchased skin products with my sensitivities and reactions knowing that I couldn't return something if it didn't work for me.  I was shocked and the woman was so mean and rude and almost seemed to be enjoying my disappointment. Now I have $80+ worth of product that I will never use/cannot sue and a very bad taste in my mouth about Make Up Forever. I am very disappointed with the company and very shocked that this woman that I had to deal with at KOL is able to keep her job. I am going to keep trying to make contact with somebody at Makeup Forever and hope for the best.

I eat out every night and like to keep a few special places in my pocket. This one is a keeper. My favorite is Seven Stars. This may give it a run for their money. I can hardly wait until I can check out their regular menu. 
The owner Jeff was great. I walk with a cane and he made sure I was taken care of, even offering to drive my car around to me. 
I will be back. And back.

Well I went back to try out the regular dining experience. 
Very pleased.
The only negatives are there are too many steps. Little fat men consider such things. I also would prefer a 4:30 opening but that's dealable.  
The service is amazing. It's not that they refilled my coffee, they never let it empty!
The lobster bisque was great. Wish they'd try Snapper. 
For dinner I had the duck breast. It was great just a bit on the small side. Desert was the best pecan pie I've ever had. 

Will I go back?? Without doubt. Of course I'm off to camp next week for two months so I don't have a chance to reach ""Oh Murray! Would you like your usual seat?"" status. 
But I will.

IyTS0URJP2rdY0is-cZC-w,5,"When asked what my favorite place to eat here in New Orleans, I always pause and ponder. But really, one place always comes to mind immediately... and it's Bacchanal. 

Bacchanal is a triple threat - good atmosphere, good music, and good food. The steak is always a good
choice and the shaved brussel sprouts. Even if you're just stopping by for a snack, a cheese board is a good call. This is a spot that will satisfy both the meat eater and the vegetarian. 

I will say that I've seen this place change quite a bit over the years. Some good changes, some bad. The food situation has improved immensely. And the addition of the bar upstairs means that you can enjoy Bacchanal year round. However the wine selection has gotten pricier and the crowds are huge nowadays. On a decent night, definitely expect a good wait before getting a table outside while the live music is going. Still I find myself returning to Bacchanal again and again and being satisfied each time. I live in the neighborhood now which helps too. 

Bacchanal has so much to offer that you're bound to enjoy yourself one way or another. Whether it's the delicious food, or the local live music, or the extensive wine and cheese selection, or just sitting outside with good company on a beautiful New Orleans night in one of the coolest neighborhoods in town, Bacchanal is a treat.

PvNe129VzT6gHA9WsG_BtA,1,"The first time I ordered here I was quite impressed with how good their French Dip was and their fries were salty perfection! The online ordering went smooth, although their website is not up to date & as basic as you can get. Delivery was within 30 minutes so I was happy with that.

The reason I am only giving one stars is because the second time I ordered, I ordered the same thing except when I got it my fries were ice cold not just room temperature but ice cold, and my sandwich was covered with Swiss cheese. Everybody knows a French dip does not have cheese on it nor did it have it on it just two days ago when I ordered from this place for the first time. So I called to let them know that they gave me the wrong sandwich and a lady proceeded to argue with me and tell me all their French dips come with Swiss cheese. I told her that they didn't in the past and if she would take a moment and look on her website that it does not say Swiss cheese. She proceeded to raise her voice and argue with me, then finally said ""what do you want me to do about it?"" All snotty. When I told her well obviously I would like the sandwiches that I paid for I do not like Swiss cheese I do not want any cheese I want what I ordered, she hung up on me. So I called the delivery driver and let them know I want the sandwich that I ordered. An hour later the very nice delivery driver delivered my sandwich with many apologies. She really was so nice at that point I had forgiven everything and we just wanted to eat I was absolutely ravenous and took a big bite out of my sandwich almost inhaling it. There was something crunchy in it which I thought a bit odd but figured maybe it was an onion that didn't cook all the way and at that point I didn't care I was starving but by the time I finished chewing and swallowed it my mouth was on absolute fire and I could feel a slow burn in the pit of my stomach. Within seconds I could taste jalapeno. So I called back after searching through the rest of the sandwich and finding One very small piece of jalapeno left. It was pretty obvious to me that the girl who is pissy on the phone thought she'd be cute by sticking a jalapeno in my sandwich. There was only one in the whole sandwich unfortunately I got most of it in the first bite. The manager proceeded to tell me his employees wouldn't give me something like that and that his sandwiches are quality check before going out. Hmm really??? Then how did the first sandwich get out of the place wrong? And how come my stomach is still burning it now or later? (I can't eat jalapenos anymore due to an ulcer) so basically my stomach is in pain and I can't eat. He then proceeded to tell me how he's been in business 10 years and he knows what he's doing... Yada yada yada. 

I am really disappointed as this was going to be one of my favorite lunch places and I really try to support local businesses but there is no way I will ever order from here again. $15 per sandwich, small fry and a 12 ounce soda is ridiculous to have to throw away. 

I would've been quite willing to try the place again and was quite willing to leave a good review as mistakes happen but the attitude by the employee, hanging up on me, and the managers total indifference to his customers has left more than just A bad taste and burn in my mouth....

The Garcia pizza was eehhhh.. It needed something like salt or parm cheese. Idk but it lacked some flavor. I tried a beermosa which was odd but not bad. The menu is extensive and had many vegetarian options. 


Recently went back for the bedotter brew. And both times was told its out. So that's disappointing. Maybe they should brew more since it's really popular. The food is pretty good. The salmon egg rolls and the sweet potato fries are tasty. The stuffed mushrooms and the Brussels sprouts, both good. The seafood pot pie... Ehh .. Not so much. Very bland. wasn't hot when served. I barely touched it. And for $24 I was kinda pissed. The giant brownie sundae thing .. OMG. That's awesome. 

Maybe next time we go back they'll have some bedotter for us to try.

I somehow managed to avoid the crazy lunch time crowd everyone warns against. Maybe Mondays at 11:15 is the secret down time? Even though the restaurant was full there was no line and I was in and out with my lunch in less than ten minutes. Great service and friendly waitstaff. 

I ordered the Chicken Shack Ranch because I feel like bacon, cheese and ranch are where a person should always start. Man it was good. Like so good I have already planned to come back and order it again the following day good. I've also started a list of other sandwiches I want to try. No doubt each sandwich will be better than the next. Anyone want to come with me? I feel like this should be a group effort. 

Take a break from that semi local chain (cough Panera) and eat at a real local place who is doing it right.",LRzTcokZgQJtYCnGsS5psw,5,"I think I owe an update because I am now a weekly visitor. 

Go to Blues City. Just go. Don't be afraid of the lines. It moves quickly and is usually the sign of a worthy establishment. Also don't be afraid if you are standing in line and a firetruck, St. Louis PD swat and multiple EMT's show up. Chances are no one is in trouble, they are there to eat. 

New favorites: The Big Tommy, Chicken Shack Ranch, and basically any special on the board. Also the chocolate chip cookies have that wonderful crispy edge gooey center thing going on. 

In summary: Go to Blues City. Stand awkwardly next to people while you all wait in line. Eat all the things. Repeat weekly.

uOURdR9Mvam-SrZ6fProsg,1,"I went to Zagol for lunch yesterday because I got a coupon from Living Social.  When I informed the owner, she asked me if I had the coupon printed out.  I politely informed her that I do not print the coupons because it is a mobile application and it says to show the coupon on the phone.  I have never had to print a coupon from Living Social or Groupon.  She then went on to say, in a very accusatory manner, ""How do I know you won't go back and print the coupon and try to use it twice?"" I explained to her the unique verification code can only be used once.  She then got mad at ME saying how the coupon company didn't tell her when the coupon would be activated.  I'm sorry, but how was this my fault and why must she yell at me for it?! SHE signed up for the deal and should have read the information prior to agreeing to do the deal! All this before I was even seated to eat. Grrr. I thought about flipping her the bird and leaving, but I held my composure.   Another group of people came in immediately after me with the Living Social coupon on their phone, and she was sweet as cherry freaking pie to them. Whatever...
The food had good flavor, but I will say that for $10, there should be MUCH larger portions.  You eat with your hands which is fun, but the amount that was served looked like they portioned it with a single hand scoop as well. Since when did peas and carrots cost $10 for a single ladle? 
The lady was back in he kitchen for a long period of time, so I left my 50 cent tip plus 2 pennies for my ""2 cents"" and bailed.

i_ZUML4CL87o7VR9XKAK0Q,5,"I called ahead to see if they had availability for walk ins today and John was so personable on the phone. From the phone convo to the time I walked out, everyone was kind, patient and didn't make me feel like a kindergartener with zero tattoo experience (even though I totally am). I entered the shop within an hour of talking to John on the phone and was greeted kindly. I showed John the text I wanted and some different fonts I liked for it and he suggested one of those that would work best. As is probably often the case with girls wanting little text tattoos in a foreign language (cliche, I know), John said the size I originally envisioned was too small for the tattoo to hold up well over time. Instead of just blowing up the text to the correct font size, he took about 10 minutes to hand draw the text in the font we picked so that he could bring the letters together a little more so it would appear a little smaller without compromising the clarity of the ink. 

I'm extremely picky and had him put the placement stencil on in literally seven different places--some varying by mere millimeters. He never once made me feel rushed or like I was being annoying, even though I'm sure I was super annoying. At one point, after John had already spent an hour with me drawing the text and putting the stencil on for the fifth time, he really sweetly said, ""and no worries if you feel hesitant. If you'd rather go home and think on it, you totally can."" He didn't say it in a way that implied he was frustrated with me and wanted me out of the shop--I could tell he genuinely just wanted me to be happy with it and have no doubts. Well on attempt #7, the stencil just FELT right going on my skin and I knew even before looking in the mirror that it was in the right spot. 

Finally, I got in the chair. I was super nervous--I wondered if I might faint or not be able to sit still or handle the pain, but I survived. I was really surprised--my tattoo is on the rib area but I didn't experience it as painful. It was just like a sensation that I guess I recognized should be called pain, but for some reason my mind didn't react to it and I actually was able to find enjoyment in the sensation. I don't have other tattoos so I don't know if this had to do with John's light touch or what, but I'm gonna go ahead and say it was that because I'm a huge baby about pain. 

I started out with my headphones in just to calm the nerves but after a few minutes I took them out and chatted with John and occasionally two other artists for the rest of the time. It was done in about 30 minutes. I was in the shop from 11:30 to 2:30 and actively taking up John's time (drawing, printing and reprinting stencils, changing the placement) so for all that time and work, I thought the price was very reasonable. I'm eager to go home and take my bandage off once the obligatory two hours has elapsed.

mbjXq0gNv4oHSCEideqzxQ,5,"Khyber was a great find for a trip to Philly. My girlfriend and I stumbled upon it when we were looking for a place to eat. I would definitely come back here.

The pub:
The area is sectioned into a bar area and a seating area. The bar was completely full when we came in and there were two decent sized groups in the seating area. The noise level was loud but we were able to still talk to each other if we leaned in and talked a bit louder. The lights are dimmed down but there are candles on the table that give a very warm atmosphere. The decor was very ""pub like"" and there were nice wooden benches to sit on for tables. 

The food:
+Bacon Grease Popcorn
We seen so many reviews recommending the popcorn so we had to try it. There's a reason for the hype. The popcorn was incredible. It had such an intense flavor from the bacon grease that it felt like if you ate the bag of popcorn, you would be satisfied with that as a meal. At the same time, I wasn't able to eat this popcorn like I would other popcorn or chips. My hand kept plunging in for more but at a certain point, I just couldn't anymore. It wasn't that I was full, it was that I think the flavor was almost too much for me to have it all in one go. This wasn't a big deal however. We took the popcorn home to eat and we managed to eat it over several days. The popcorn didn't show signs of becoming stale until the fourth day in and it was just left out, wrapped in a plastic bag. The popcorn comes in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down so that you get maybe 3/4 of a standard brown bag. When its brought out, dots of oil will already begin to show on the brown bag, almost as if it were a signature mark to an amazing snack. I would highly recommend getting this cheap and amazing appetizer and would definitely get this if I were to come back. 

+Roast Duck Sandwich
The roast duck was pretty good but I didn't eat much of it. It was my girlfriend's meal. It was a special that day and I think it was well worth it but I wouldn't get it again if we came back.

+Pulled Pork
I never had pulled pork before so I thought it was a bit dry. However, the sauces they provide you with go above and beyond to make this meal amazing. The three sauces are either vinegar based, mustard based, or ketchup based. My preference was the mustard then the ketchup and leagues behind is the vinegar for the simple fact that the vinegar was just a liquid and I like my sauces thicker. I realized I am not a huge fan of pulled pork however, and would not get this again.

The duck and pork came with sides:
+Cheddar Cheese Fries
The fries were pretty good but nothing special about them in my opinion. The cheddar cheese was nice but it wasn't too different from other cheese fries I've had. 

+Mashed Potatoes
These mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had. They aren't those pureed potatoes that you get from Boston Market or KFC. They were mashed enough so that they had a consistent... consistency but they were as liquidy as pureed mash. They had the skins on them still which I am a huge fan for and they were seasoned very well. The right amount. I would get these again.

+Baked Mac n Cheese
This was the best part of the meal, second to the popcorn. There wasn't anything too special about this mac n cheese and yet it was so delicious. The breading was just the right amount, maybe a bit less than I would have liked and the cheese was so very creamy. I would definitely come back for more. 

This was a nice place and I could definitely see people coming here with a bunch of their friends, getting some drinks and getting the amazing bacon grease popcorn to share. For a couples place, I think it was too loud but we definitely enjoyed it for a date. Just as long as it isn't too busy.",8elcvgZ_HoXoKUbzTla1Gw,4,"Khyber was a great find for a trip to Philly.

These mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had. They aren't those pureed potatoes that you get from Boston Market or KFC. They were mashed enough so that they had a consistent... consistency but they were as liquidy as pureed mash. They had the skins on them still which I am a huge fan for and they were seasoned very well. The right amount. I would get these again.

+Baked Mac n Cheese
This was the best part of the meal, second to the popcorn. There wasn't anything too special about this mac n cheese and yet it was so delicious. The breading was just the right amount, maybe a bit less than I would have liked and the cheese was so very creamy. I would definitely come back for more. 

This was a nice place and I could definitely see people coming here with a bunch of their friends, getting some drinks and getting the amazing bacon grease popcorn to share. For a couples place, I think it was too loud but we definitely enjoyed it for a date. Just as long as it isn't too busy."

wg0cUODwIXMXj3IfmtHXWQ,4,"Updated: Back in St Louis, I returned to 4 Hands. This time I found a snarky, unhelpful beertender.  It was mid afternoon and the place was not overly busy.  So I tried a few beers, at a table away from the bar.  The beers remain good, worth trying and i am sure that when I return the beers will be equally good and there will be different folks working the bar. 


Interesting craft brewery near downtown and the baseball stadium, serving specialty craft beer.  Street parking was difficult to find, but once I did, I was glad I made it here. The tasting room is adjacent to the brewery and it was fun and educational to look through large windows and watch the master brewers turn raw ingredients in the large vats into 4 Hands beers.  Each of the ones I sampled had good flavor. There is a wide variety of 4 Hands on tap - the point being that they have lighter beers, more bitter IPAs, double IPAs, porters and stouts and 10-15 others in-between. Try the milk stout -- Wow!!!  For beer lovers in St. Louis or those who visit, please go by and encourage these men and women who are bringing real flavor back to American beer one small batch at a time.  Thanks for the experience.",R6gmTGj5HEJUri5wAwcQ6g,5,"Interesting craft brewery near downtown and the baseball stadium, serving specialty craft beer.

UPDATE as of 11/26....I will say that someone reached out to me from Edgehill apologizing for the experience (not my intention in writing this review!)

This is the type of place I want to like. I really want to support more adventurous restaurants in Isla Vista in hopes to garner more businesses that will try something more brave than the standard pizza, burger, and burrito that our town seems to know and love more than is healthy.

Unfortunately, I just can't give this place my business.

#1 It's dirty.
I'm all for a hole in the wall where everything isn't spic, spam, shiny, and chrome, but this place made me uncomfortable to eat inside. It's just straight up not clean, not to mention visually unappealing. Lotta grey and brown and weird spots everywhere.

#2 It's slow
This might not be such an issue if #1 wasn't a problem. But since it's an uncomfortable place to sit and wait, waiting 15-20 minutes in an empty restaurant where I'm afraid I might catch something isn't fun.

Now that I've vented...

The food here is actually not bad. The meats are juicy, tender, and fresh. The portions are large. The hummus is excellent.

I think it will be another place that just can't sustain the sales to stay open. Hope I'm wrong.

Update.  Made an appointment yesterday for  today to have my new set of tires installed.  This time they were ready for me and service went smoothly.  The tires were installed in 1 1/2 to 2 hours while we waited and shopped at nearby businesses like Savers and JoAnn's craft store.  We ate nearby at La Michoacana... (See review).

We also tried the avocado toast but it was just mediocre (I promise I'm not a picky eater!) I will say the biscuits were fantastic and I basically ate just that alone.

QeFhZuu2SNoiDb1JPgaGPA,1,"After being really unhappy after the second time getting highlights in my hair, I gave my hair guy in California a call and ask him what he used in my hair for 16+ years. 

So yesterday I stopped at the salon to talk to Katie about the product he used and if she could use the same for my up coming appointment.  At the time Katie was with a client, so I spoke with her husband Scott and explained I was not happy with my hair after my last appointment, and couldn't tell that my hair had even been done. I showed him the a text my old hair guy sent saying how and a picture of what products he used.  So Scott starts off by telling me he's never heard of that product ( Clairol ) and that people who use that stuff are aggressive and don't care about damage they cause. I told him it's been used on my hair for 16+ years and I've never had a problem before.  I asked about what if I were to go buy it and bring it to my appointment, and he said they don't use other people's products.  So he tried to explain what they do, and I tried to explain that I couldn't even tell my hair had been done, and he looks at my hair and said I see 4-5 months worth of growth.  

And that's my point. It's been 2 months since I had my hair done by Katie, yet I have 4-5 months worth of growth.

The Pho is also very very good... it comes to the table piping hot with fresh sprouts and basil to add as desire.  I found that a few good doses of rooster sauce (sriracha) brought the flavor to just where I like it.  Final verdict: we both agreed that we would willingly order the same again... but will try other dishes as well.

Service was very good,  courteous and efficient and Lilly is a great hostess.

First off ask for the dim sum menu. Order a couple of the items. Then settle in for some good chow fun dry style. I always ask for chow fun without bean sprouts. The potstickers are done fresh.

When we sat down the woman immediately took the chop sticks off the table and brought back forks ( we are not Asian). Then we ordered hot tea and when we got that we weren't quite ready to order so we said we needed a few minutes. Once we were ready I couldn't get anyone to come over for at least 15 minutes. I finally flagged down someone who was running by. 

The BBQ pork wonton soup was ok. The Mongolian beef was supposed to be spicy, but came out really bland.

A quick 30-40 minute lunch took over 1 hour and 15 minutes. Kind of ridiculous.

4ze-QWsZ2FbRVJ9tpY5cLw,5,"Thank god there is now a Costco on the southside. I love this place but ... The north side location is too far away to take full advantage. 

Good selection is nice... And a lot of things I've found a very sufficient savings on; eggs, some condiments, coconut water and more. 

I like finding little gadgets that somehow are both practical and something I've meant to buy... Just hadn't taken the time. 

I used my ""free pizza"" voucher recently and was happy with the pie. Even at 9.99, it seemed like a fair deal when one does not feel like doing any food prep after unloading a vehicle. A vehicle that has an extra $100 worth of shit I didn't plan on buying when I walked in the door. 

The staff has been helpful... Samples are convenient, as are the trash cans so I do not carry shrapnel from 7 samples through every aisle as I must make sure I haven't missed anything new. 

Some things are way too large of a supply for me unless having a party or the decision I love rice to the tune of 20+Lbs. to each their own. 

I have a feeling when I check my 2% balance I'm both going both be happy at the ""free"" money, but there could be a little sticker shock of what that means I've spent here.",GG0TFle51NYokPtBAUYGqg,5,"Thank god there is now a Costco on the southside.

qrymMIXn22hu_eivEKZPbg,3,"I put this review off for too long because I wasn't sure how I felt about it. This place Is called Earl's, but it isn't Earl's. And I guess this isn't a review so much as it is a comparison between this place, and the place that used to be here before the fire, which was called Earl's.
    We had lunch here last month, not long after they reopened and we were very excited because we loved the old place(5 stars for sure). The new décor inside is totally different from before. Not in a bad way, a lot of natural light, and the wood furniture has a light almost rustic look to it. The old place was a little more intimate, softer lighting, dark mahogany stained wood finishes. I guess the idea of having a more casual atmosphere for the reopening is supposed to help attract more people who haven't been to the old place but, I think the old Earl's felt a little classier, and for the money I'm spending, I don't want to be ""classy pretending to be casual"", I want the goods from the host at the front door to the mints on my way out.
    Two cocktails to start, and they were both very nice. Then salad, which was salad. I have to note here that we almost always get appetizers when we eat out because, well do I need a reason for appetizers? I like to try a lot of stuff so when I go out to eat, I eat a little bit when I get there before I eat while I'm there. Anyway no apps this time, why? There wasn't a great selection to choose from and none of them grabbed me. To be fair, it was lunch, and there are a few more choices for dinner but, even the two or three options I didn't have weren't calling out to me. My wife thinks I was expecting too much of the old place in the new menu. This might be somewhat true, they had some amazing appetizers before. I will never forget the first time I had there Portobello fries. Crispy beer batter on the outside, hot delicious Portobello on the inside, served in a ramekin full of garlic aioli, SO delicious. Any way we didn't have any of the ok looking apps this time.
    House made  fusilli with local wild mushrooms, spring asparagus, and roasted garlic in tomato sauce for her, house made pappardelle with Hudson valley duck confit, fiddle-head ferns, and mascarpone cheese for me. Both were well done, pappardelle was a little greasy but, its duck confit so, it's going to have some grease.
    I have no complaints. But I still feel like I didn't have the kind of experience that I was expecting. I knew it wasn't going to be exactly the same as it was before, but when a place is that good and they get a chance try something new, I want to be WOWED! This was more like ""meh, that was good"". Oh, I also read in another review for the new place that the service was slow and I agree. Good, but slow. I'm not sure if this is a totally fair review, being more of a comparison, and they are still new in a way.

PS4lDQGbROBlltINCTVzhA,1,"After being really unhappy after the second time getting highlights in my hair, I gave my hair guy in California a call and ask him what he used in my hair for 16+ years. 

So yesterday I stopped at the salon to talk to Katie about the product he used and if she could use the same for my up coming appointment.  At the time Katie was with a client, so I spoke with her husband Scott and explained I was not happy with my hair after my last appointment, and couldn't tell that my hair had even been done. I showed him the a text my old hair guy sent saying how and a picture of what products he used.  So Scott starts off by telling me he's never heard of that product ( Clairol ) and that people who use that stuff are aggressive and don't care about damage they cause. I told him it's been used on my hair for 16+ years and I've never had a problem before.  I asked about what if I were to go buy it and bring it to my appointment, and he said they don't use other people's products.  So he tried to explain what they do, and I tried to explain that I couldn't even tell my hair had been done, and he looks at my hair and said I see 4-5 months worth of growth.  

And that's my point. It's been 2 months since I had my hair done by Katie, yet I have 4-5 months worth of growth.  




In response to your lies of what really happened:

My last visit was June 18, 2016 and according to my bank statement payment was made to you on June 20, 2016, so your records are WRONG.  I've also have had the same products used on my hair for years, and my hair is to my waist with no damage so your again your WRONG. And when I came into your salon my hair was in a bun, so how were you able to see so much damage? You couldn't and you didn't.  And I NEVER ASKED OR SUGGESTED I wanted my hair done for free, it never even crossed my mind. And I NEVER asked for my highlights to be blended in, but asked for it to be light as possible.  It's really sad that you feel the need to lie, instead of trying to work with a client.",QeFhZuu2SNoiDb1JPgaGPA,1,"After being really unhappy after the second time getting highlights in my hair, I gave my hair guy in California a call and ask him what he used in my hair for 16+ years.

The manager is very hands on and really seems to really know the business. I really needed my check and my waiter was tending to another table, the manager noticed and got me my check and packed my leftovers asap. 

Update:

I came here again and it was an overall another wonderful experience. 

 I got the vanilla chai tea latte again, they didn't have the sugar spoon, wasn't sure if this was a mistake or they are no longer doing it, but it was delicious as always. The salted caramel waffles were amazing, I asked for no bacon.  In the southern eggs Benedict the cornbread is the best part. I will admit I prefer sweets over savory which is why i found it just okay when it was pretty much perfection it it's appearance and taste from the description given. and a chocolate milkshake.

The designer who came out to our house brought us the manufacturer spec sheet that shows the rug at 8x10 and the store spec sheet showing the rug measurement of 8x11...apparently the dimension was entered incorrectly at the corporate level. I have requested a pro-rated refund, of about 9%, as I did not get the rug I ordered and paid for-I got a rug a full foot shorter than my order. I have heard nothing yet about that   
One  of my chairs has a squeak, that is getting worse by the day and won't be repaired for another two weeks. 
The store refunded the delivery charge in a timely manner for the inconvenience of the missing rug pads.; that was last Wednesday.I did receive a voicemail from the designer on Monday, and I was not able to call the until today. The voicemail said nothing about the pads being found.
The delivery people were great, very careful, polite, and quick. I am very disappointed with the store people and their lack of timely repair services and communications. 
***Update*** I received the  pad for the runner this morning, 4/14. The area rug pad was supposed to be delivered today as well. When I called the store to advise the pad was not delivered, I was told the sales rep would look into why it was not delivered and call me back; i called at about 1:15 this afternoon and as of now, 5:00, i have had no word.. I also inquired about the pro-rata refund for the part of the rug that I paid for but didn't receive. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the order was placed for an 8x10 area not 8x11. I will be taking my paperwork to the store so this sales rep can see for herself that she did order an 8x11 rug and that she did NOT order an 8x10 rug. I do not appreciate being told I am wrong, or a liar, when I know i am correct and the sales rep is wrong. 
It is frustrating that the cheapest items in my order are the ones giving me the headaches. 
May , 3, 2017 update:
I did visit the store in April to show the sales rep-Abby- that she indeed ordered an 8x11 area rug as evidenced by every single set of order papers I have. She insisted that the rug was ordered correctly as 8x10...repeatedly telling me i did not understand. Seeing that no further headway was possible with Abby regarding the misleading and false info on my paperwork I then inquired about the missing area rug pad. She said she finally got an answer from their warehouse in response to her email. Apparently the pad had been lost AGAIN. 
Imagine my surprise when we installed the runner pad and it was two full feel SHORT. . When I went to the store about the very short pad i was told abby would order it and call me the following Saturday to confirm it was ordered. No surprise here, she never called to confirm that order.
I waited a full week for her to call. Finally I emailed their ""comfort care"" email address detailing my list of problems with my order. Lindsey emailed me back, apologizing for the hassles I have had with this order, and offered to refund the cost of the arm/headrest ""napkins"" at $111.30 for the inconveniences. So far so good then Lindsey advised that she could not handle rug/ pad issues. I called first and spoke to Chuck about my frustrations most notably that his sales woman sold us something that does not exist and that I wanted a 9% refund on the area rug, totaling $57.24. They are ordering a new larger runner pad at no cost to me. 
Very long incomplete story short, they are refusing to refund 9% of the sales price for the missing foot of area rug and I still don't have the proper size runner pad nor the area rug pad. I am very dissatisfied with their ""customer service"" at the store level. If i could i would give them ZERO STARS. It's a shame because I really like my furniture. Dallas the store manager has NO interest in seeing us satisfied all over $57.24and seems he can ignore corporate directives at will. All I can say is-double/triple/quadruple check your order before paying one cent, don't believe any of the info in writing and question everything the sales rep tells you."

At this point, I want a full refund, so I can purchase a refrigerator somewhere else.

Update 7/27:  I wish I could give them less than one star.  I called the vendor myself today, and was told no one from Menard's ever contacted them.   The vendor said it was Menard's responsibility as the seller to follow up on this order, and the customer should not have to deal with this.

""Thank you for your email.  I am very sorry for your recent experience with the St. Ann Menards store! I have sent a cancellation request to our vendor for your order.

The cook came over to talk with me and with his help I picked a nice variety that I wouldn't have imagined that I could eat: portabello mushroom stuffed with crab meat, cream cheese with roasted tomatoes on top, bacon wrapped chicken livers with Asian sauce, beef kebab with mushrooms & green peppers, roasted Brussel sprouts and corn on the with parmesan cheese. This came with house salad and two glasses of wine for $20. It was a good deal!  
Bonus- we are on the patio with warm sun and a nice breeze. After days & days of rain this is just what I needed. Plus, a live guitar/harmonica playing singer Joe Fry Guitrrguy, playing 60s-80s tunes. I may embarrass John and do a dance!   Extra bonus- they have a peated Scotch!  I'm loving it.
The reason I have gone from 4 stars to 3 is because I had some digestive upset the next morning: having celiac disease I cannot have more than 1/4 of a teaspoon of gluten, if I do I have issues.

dH0eVjI71Ap_SCvsKXeKOw,5,"I sincerely hope this review is posted.  Originally it was placed in the filtered reviews.  I am totally legit.  I live in the MIdwest, but travel frequently.  My daughters went to school at Princeton and because of that, I got to know the Philadelphia/Princeton area very well.

         I  want to tell you about an amazing hair care professional.  His name is Daniel Citro and he is extremely knowledgeable about hair.  His talent really shines when giving a haircut.  I am very picky about my hair.  I first met Daniel in Princeton NJ. I was referred to him by a skin care specialist who trained and worked in NYC.  When I called to make an appointment with him (after going to him twice)  I discovered he had left. I made a concerted effort to track him down.  I found him at the Adolf Biecker Salon in Philadelphia.     When he gives a haircut, my hair looks good without having to use a curling iron, etc.    I can blow it dry and it looks great.  I have shoulder length plus hair.  After he cuts it, when I pull it back, it looks full and even. I can not say that about cuts from some other people I have encountered.   I currently live in the Midwest.  I wait to get my hair cut when I travel East.  If I need to, I just have it trimmed until I can make an appointment with him.  Just describe to him what you would like.  He will make every effort to accommodate your wishes, but will give you his opinion.  I have learned a great deal about caring for and styling my hair by listening to him. Daniel has trained in Italy and has worked and (I believe) trained in New York also. In my opinion, he is highly respected in his profession.      If you are looking for someone to give you a truly great haircut, book an appointment with Daniel.  Just do it!  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!  If you are in a hurry and choose the vale parking, they validate your ticket for a 25% discount.

Upon entering no one is there to greet you and a bunch of ppl were just standing at the so called hostess stand looking around. Completely disorganized and there seem to be no system to how they were seating parties. There was an older lady with glasses that looked so overwhelmed. This was apparent in her demeanor. She didn't look like she wanted to be there and was disgustingly rude and dismissive. I approached to ask if we could get on a list (for a party of 10!!!!!!!!) but before I could say anything she told me to ""MOVE! I need to get back there"" with an eye roll. So I moved aside and thought once she placed the menus down she will at the very least acknowledge or assist us but no she doubled down on her bad attitude and continued to ignore us. Needless to say we will NOT be back. If this is how they treat you upon entering their doors I can't imagine how much care they put into their food. I would give this place -2 stars.

Gi58c2C3ZOoabsspDB4W9g,1,The serviceman was very nice.  He adjusted two toilets so they would flush efficiently. I also had a new kitchen faucet I wanted to have installed. He received an estimate for the installation from the home office.  The estimated charge was $629.00.  Unbelievable! I sent him on his way......I paid the 69.00 trip fee.  So the estimate was $629.00 to install the faucet.  The serviceman adjusted the water flow in the toilets and said they were fine.  I watched a 10 minute video showing how to install a faucet on you tube.  Hardly a job worth $629.00!

I also had a new kitchen faucet I wanted to have installed. He received an estimate for the installation from the home office.  The estimated charge was $629.00.  Unbelievable! I sent him on his way......

Once I found out, I tried to cancel the service, but it was after the 14 day cancellation. Now AT&T is willing to ""refund"" half of the early termination fee of $150, but I'm on the hook for the other half.

UPDATE as of 11/26....I will say that someone reached out to me from Edgehill apologizing for the experience (not my intention in writing this review!) Good on them - of course there are kinks to iron out during the first few months and it shows integrity when the restaurant takes note.

s2itoYbiI0C6OkC2JRPyZg,3,"I am a picky Cuban-American and my friend is an even pickier Puerto Rican. We were driving by and decided to stop and try Mi Caribe since St. Louis's selection of Latino restaurants leaves something to be desired. What a find!

The owner helped us and was very friendly. He took a lot of pride in the restaurant and told us where each piece of art work came from. He informed us that the chef was Dominican and that many of the dishes were prepared Dominican style. 

My friend wanted the mofongo but was on the fence because she doesn't like Dominican mofongo. The owner assured us that that all of the Puerto Rican customers seemed very pleased with the dish. She ordered one for herself and we both loved it. We were so impressed that we ordered 4 to go to feed our families for dinner.

I ordered the vaca con tostones and was equally impressed. The skirt steak was very well seasoned. Even though the steak was on top of the tostones, the tostones were crispy and delicious. 

I recommend this place to anyone who misses or likes authentic Dominican, Puerto Rican or Cuban food. We'll definitely be returning.

UPDATE:

After having such a positive experience, my friend and I returned yesterday. Wow, what a change. The service was terrible. We ordered a pork mofongo and a shrimp mofongo. 1+1=2, right? Well, the waitress didn't think so. She only brought the pork mofongo. She argued with my friend about what was ordered, which was very unprofessional. Not to mention the fact that she was flat-out wrong. She said she would bring out the shrimp mofongo in 20 minutes. Instead, she brought a plate of shrimp. Again, she argued about what we ordered and tried to charge us for the plate of shrimp! The owner was sitting nearby and heard the whole ordeal. He never intervened or apologized. Again, very unprofessional and overall terrible, especially for a new restaurant trying to build its reputation. 

On the upside, the pork mofongo was delicious so props to the chef. I just wish the rest of the experience had been more positive.",upG3cQGB7DmUQAVMdHcGYQ,5,"I am a picky Cuban-American and my friend is an even pickier Puerto Rican.

I know it's a fast food joint, but this is the worst! I witnessed them making food without gloves on! Disgusting! I even told the cashier to tell them to put gloves on, but he walked right past them. It took over 20 minutes to get my food and about ten minutes to get my order taken! Ridiculous! I warned a few customers too about them wearing no gloves and they walked out.

9fO3S9XyDgA_RFBMLDzmGQ,4,"This hospital is awesome (all in all)! I delivered my son here almost 5 months ago. The environment feels very welcoming and the staff really takes the time to answer your questions. They seem to really care about their patients and making a pregnant woman feel comfortable in a painful situation. The rooms have great furniture with plenty of room to make patient guests feel comfortable too. The food is really good too making a couple day stay more than manageable. The reason I don't give this hospital a perfect 5 is because they are somewhat lacking when it comes to the comfort of the spouse. My husband stayed with me for the 2.5 days I was here and the hospital doesn't allow your spouse to order food at meal times. This ended up being an inconvenience because when it was time to take care of my newborn, he wasn't always there to help me feed and change  him because he had to go to the cafeteria to eat. It's hard enough when you are trying to recover from the birthing experience and just a little while later you cannot rest because you have to care for your newborn and your spouse would be there to help at all times, if he didn't have to exit to get food. I mean come on, I understand the man isn't physically giving birth, but the experience is exhausting for him too and a meal would be a nice gesture. After all, my bill for a two and a half day hospital stay was approx $40,000 and my spouse can't even get his meals taken care of??

We stood inside the door for approximately 15 minutes while being completely ignored. We tried to amuse ourselves by looking at the wines.

Since I have learned that Parkallen clients apparently are invisible for the first fifteen minutes after they enter the door to this restaurant, I recommend that you use this facility as a washroom rest stop.  However, if you want to dine or have a little wine or a celebration, go elsewhere.

RuR4kCd494G312xXbRlgyw,1,"Unfortunately this was not a good stay. It's unfortunate for the amount of money we dumped into one night. 
So we started off with being assigned a room. Went into the assigned room and it was a mess. Not cleaned up at all. 
Went back downstairs to get a new room, and then proceeded to the new room. Upon arrival in the new room, wasn't clean either. Really looked as if someone made the bed (hopefully clean sheets) and folded the towels. Looked down at the floor and there was hair everywhere. Hair from the head and hair from other places as well. 
Smell in the room was not appetizing at all either. 
The cleaning ladies (both floors that we went to) were on their phones hanging out in the room at the end of the hallway. I know why the rooms weren't clean. 
For a room this size, and lack of cleanliness, I could have easily stayed at motel 6 and received better service. 
Very disappointed. Getting in contact with AAA also to let them know since this is an advertised hotel on their site. I trust AAA and they probably have no idea.

YKTm96Am73NKu7CF0xKRZA,4,"It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and my girlfriend and I just ventured out of a nearby lululemon store searching for the perfect place to eat and drink away any memory of all of the money spent. We found this Italian chophouse with a piano in the window and decided to give it a go. 

After being seated at a very nice table, we were greeted by a wonderful server, who was extremely knowledgeable and considerate to our requests. She recommended two excellent full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon to match our meal. 

Now the meal: 

For starters, she brought out this bread that was fresh out of the oven; so hot that when we ""broke bread"", it was an eruption of delicious steam that stimulated our sense of olfaction so much that we had to order seconds. My girlfriend has a rather odd sense of taste if you ask me (something she likes to call ""refined""), and doesn't like blue cheese- but not to worry! Our delightful waitress was very accommodating as to split the salad in half and include the blue cheese on mine and put fresh Mozzarella on hers. As they have a renowned raw bar, I also ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was great as expected. 

For the main course, I ordered the Veal Parmigiana (which was originally chicken until she allowed me to substitute the veal) and she ordered the Chicken Piccata. Both were phenomenal and a testament to how extraordinary this restaurant is. In a place where great Italian food is limited, Timpano really takes the cake. 

Why 4 stars and not 5? 

They did not have Feta cheese for the salad that she wanted.

They pride themselves on their hand aged meats, and since I did not order them I could not give them the 5 stars. I will for sure try it next time. 


Definitely a place to go for a great dinner, or even lunch.

DoRAaktgFG1RrUL6QwWJag,4,"This is such an awesome location, but they persist continue to persist with the same issues. This Whole Foods location opened up a couple months ago, but it is not new to the Main Line. 

Another Whole Foods was located about 2 minutes down Wynnewood Road compared to the current location. However, that location had horrible parking as it was shared with some local businesses like Sang Kee and Dakota Pizza. The location was also on the smaller side causing overcrowding. Also, it was a bit old. 

By moving to the new, bigger location they believed they were fixing those issues. They addressed the problem, head on, they fixed most but I am not sure they fixed them all. 

First, they built an indoor and outdoor parking lot. However, these are always packed and it is always a struggle to find a parking spot. When it is very crowded workers are required. One time, a small fight broke out. The traffic pattern can be confusing as well. 

Other than that there are no real glaring issues about this location. Compared to the last location, this store is much bigger, cleaner and has a much better and healthier variety.

For example, the carts here are XL, a full size tavern and beer garden are downstairs and a juice and Smoothie bar is available. They have also expanded upon the salad bar, sushi bar, pizza kitchen and bakery.

Food wise, I absolutely love this stores hoagies. Their seasonal ""thanksgiving feast"" hoagie is off the charts. They have a somewhat ""healthy"" candy bar, which has amazing fruit snacks. Finally, their salad bar is awesome with so many options from types of lettuce, to dressing, to croutons, proteins and fruits and veggies. 

This location is also environmentally friendly as it uses as little energy as little. They have non-moving check-outs and they have large factory type lights, which use less energy altogether. 

Lastly, the staff here is phenomenal. They are welcoming, helpful, well-informed and k ow how to make good food.

ycwslvay7yv_N0vmTxvQeA,5,"This is not a review about the salon itself, but about a person who work in the salon.  
I want to tell you about an amazing hair care professional.  His name is Daniel Citro and he is extremely knowledgeable about hair.  His talent really shines when giving a haircut.  I am very picky about my hair.  I first met Daniel in Princeton NJ. I was referred to him by a skin care specialist who trained and worked in NYC.  When I called to make an appointment with him (after going to him twice)  I discovered he had left. I made a concerted effort to track him down.  I found him at the Adolf Biecker Salon in Philadelphia.     When he gives a haircut, my hair looks good without having to use a curling iron, etc.    I can blow it dry and it looks great.  I have shoulder length plus hair.  After he cuts it, when I pull it back, it looks full and even. I can not say that about cuts from some other people I have encountered.   I currently live in the Midwest.  I wait to get my hair cut when I travel East.  If I need to, I just have it trimmed until I can make an appointment with him.  Just describe to him what you would like.  He will make every effort to accommodate your wishes, but will give you his opinion.  I have learned a great deal about caring for and styling my hair by listening to him. Daniel has trained in Italy and has worked and (I believe) trained in New York also. In my opinion, he is highly respected in his profession.      If you are looking for someone to give you a truly great haircut, book an appointment with Daniel.  Just do it!  You won't be sorry.

BfUN1HHhJmKql9Kafb79rQ,3,"Clearwater is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. We picked pier house 60 due to its great location and affordable rooms. Great size studio room but not great for noise. With the balcony closed you could still hear most of what was happening outside especially the pirate ship and beeping horns. Beds were fairly comfortable and a small but very clean continental breakfast included.

Now why I have only given 3 stars... We went to bed at 10pm our last night tucked in and by 10:30 crazy loud laughter, talking and music from the next room. I had to call at 10:30pm, 12:30am, 1:30am and 2:45am it would get quiet for a min then go right back. Finally fell asleep at 3:45 am and had to wake up for 6:30 to get out for our day. When I spoke with management they confirmed they had a 1 warning policy and we're sorry. No compensation what so ever, and the girl at the desk confirmed it was a bachelorette party. So I got less then three hours of sleep and a sorry. I'm sorry but that is unacceptable! There are plenty of hotels in the area with great and even better views that will get my business, not here!

And there was a line of others complaining about their broken seats as well.

We will got be returning to this location."

I ordered an appetizer and the quail special. I was on the fence on whether to give Kanella a 4 or 5 rating, but the fact that they're a BYO pushed them up to 5 for me. Make sure to make a reservation before going, this place gets packed. I definitely need to try brunch at Kanella and other items on the menu.

Whom ever is in charge of training the waitstaff, hats off to you!   My first experience was great and tonight was spectacular!   From the timing of the presentation of food to the actual presentation itself, everything was as I expect it to be when I dine out.   So many fall short in one way or another.  NOT HERE.   Daryl was the most attentive, vibrant, enthusiastic waiter that I have had in a while.   I take nothing away from our first server because she too was great but Daryl had a certain quality that made you want to try each dish!   Thank you so much Daryl, and thanks to Chef Dom for another incredible dining experience.    I'll see you all in the spring! 

First time at Hearthside and I just cannot wait to come back!  Service was exceptional, the quality and taste of the food was nothing short of a five star restaurant and we were in Collingswood!   Perfect weather enabled the wall of glass doors to be opened up without one insect joining our table. Portions are far larger than expected. I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer and the pork chop (huge) for dinner.  I have another meal using the leftovers from both.   I thoroughly enjoyed being able to view the open kitchen, and of course,
the good looking staff!   Keep up the great work team.  There is no question that you will continue to be a success if you continue with the  efforts I witnessed this evening.

UsaZno56Jm7neAJis5caag,1,"So two days have gone by since I wrote my review and the owner, ""Lizzy"", decides to text me. Not call like a professional business woman. In which I told her, and in her defense she feels better texting a random person to complain about a review she read on yelp. I did not ask the salon for a refund, seeing she did not care to hire people  who cares about customer satisfaction. I don't have much to say to her because she continues to show her unprofessionalism especially with how she chooses to express herself and handle a negative review from an unpaid customer. I wonder if she has texted every person who said something positive about their experience? Luckily I'm a positive person and will just perceive her actions as an attempt at customer service.

POST FROM 1/31/16

I am requesting a refund, the customer service is terrible. I don't believe they plan on making anyone who comes in as a returning customer, Vanessa totally fried my hair, she had no knowledge of the process or products. I left with my hair worst than when I walked in. I had  bought  this $49 groupon for my services she then added an extra $20 on top of the $30 dollars she had told me would be extra. the groupon was also for a deep conditioning and I got nothing of the sort.  The owner did nothing to make sure the client left happy. I seriously was crying when I left, I then ran around to every beauty store to try to fix my hair. I came home and easily fixed the damage vanessa had done that SAME NIGHT! I paid $100 for something I've been doing at home and ever damaged my hair like she did. they are unprofessional and over priced. They should be closed down because they care nothing for their clients just a quick buck. while I was in there another client was blow drying her own hair. Also Vanessa had another appointment so that is another reason she DID NOT finish my hair. terrible service. I am requesting a refund, the customer service is terrible.

sfk5GEqj1CFQUJeQPPBjpA,5,I forgot to mention that if you want something definitely fresh- you have to order an alternative topping. I get a hot-n-ready with sausage and it's the same price as pepperoni- plus it's made fresh because they keep those pepperoni pizzas on standby. I also pay more extra cheese. Still a great deal for $7-8,C0CHSXvaLByZUNqruxgzBA,5,"I forgot to mention that if you want something definitely fresh- you have to order an alternative topping.

The best specialty pizzas are the pretzel crust and the smoked brisket by far- make sure to order double cheese."
jmRCrqsLIAUZmWLUmK_7gQ,4,"Stopped in here on a cold day enroute to catch a show in Philadelphia for some noodles.  Small place with trendy music, simple menu of not so simple ramen.  We were a party of 5 an seated after a very short wait.  Wow,  beef dumplings and pork belly buns were delicious starters.  Miso ramen with shredded pork shoulder and soft cooked egg, torn noodles with lamb and pickled vegetable, crab broth noodles with meatballs and brisket noodles with matzo ball all very different and not what we expected for traditional noodles but wow how delicious!!!   A bit pricey with bowl of noodle for between $12-13 a bowl plus extra for more noddles or egg or other extras but certainly worth for uniqueness and tastiness.  Didn't try the wings but looked very good - next time for sure.",YJS52EUlnTzjlpiTQPG-GQ,4,"Stopped in here on a cold day enroute to catch a show in Philadelphia for some noodles.

LN2Vq7FKDCFb6HOeYUe_EA,2,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I still felt it was worth a try because 'when in Rome!'  My husband and I got the appetizer size Crawfish Ettoufe which was freaking de-lish and I was wishing we had ordered the entree size. It's perfection! It's bold! It's creamy! It's well balanced! And the crawfish?!? Omg, tiny pieces of heaven!

We also ordered the Fried Chicken Liver because I love liver and onions over rice, a dish I grew up eating so I was excited to try it, although was ultimately disappointed. It didn't have seasoning and it was heavy on the batter, although ""fluffy"" if that makes sense. They serve it with a hot and sweet jelly which compliments the liver well. I just wasn't too crazy about the overall bland taste and it tasted grimy. 
Then we had the friend chicken with the potato salad and collard greens as sides. The potato salad isn't bad. I guess the locals make it with lots of mustard instead of mayo. Fried chicken is fried chicken, the batter was different and the chicken was moist. My biggest disappointment was the collard greens, it has no flavor. It's basically boiled with a little bit of pepper. Again, it must just be the way they cook it here. It seems some foods are bland as hell whereas others are bursting with flavor. 
Overall this being New Orleans I was expecting an explosion of local flavors, Cajun, spicy, salty, flavorful!! That's what I was hoping for. For every dish to have been given as much love and attention as the Ettoufe. Oh well...",NS13UWrhI-5Zyhi-jyVSjw,2,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I still felt it was worth a try because 'when in Rome!'

__rUZ4_8MI5jDeX3o4nvZw,4,"I stopped in Arizona Tile today, doubting that I would based on the previous review.  I am sure the previous reviewer had all those things happen, but that did not happen to me.  I had someone latch on to me immediately and I couldn't get rid of them.  They answered all my questions didn't try to talk me in to a particular item and made the whole process efficient.  I ordered the tile an all the accessories and was ""out of there"" very quickly.  The till will be in by Monday (Friday now) and the price was better than I hoped.

FfX_LE6embgWeInYOHqpng,4,"This hospital is awesome (all in all)! I delivered my son here almost 5 months ago. The environment feels very welcoming and the staff really takes the time to answer your questions. They seem to really care about their patients and making a pregnant woman feel comfortable in a painful situation. The rooms have great furniture with plenty of room to make patient guests feel comfortable too. The food is really good too making a couple day stay more than manageable. The reason I don't give this hospital a perfect 5 is because they are somewhat lacking when it comes to the comfort of the spouse. My husband stayed with me for the 2.5 days I was here and the hospital doesn't allow your spouse to order food at meal times. This ended up being an inconvenience because when it was time to take care of my newborn, he wasn't always there to help me feed and change  him because he had to go to the cafeteria to eat. It's hard enough when you are trying to recover from the birthing experience and just a little while later you cannot rest because you have to care for your newborn and your spouse would be there to help at all times, if he didn't have to exit to get food. I mean come on, I understand the man isn't physically giving birth, but the experience is exhausting for him too and a meal would be a nice gesture. After all, my bill for a two and a half day hospital stay was approx $40,000 and my spouse can't even get his meals taken care of?? Hopefully for the sake of others, they will make a change.",9fO3S9XyDgA_RFBMLDzmGQ,4,"This hospital is awesome (all in all)! I delivered my son here almost 5 months ago.

cB3rZJxF0K_kazbdFTZkRg,4,"I visit this restaurant often as I work downtown. I always get the lasagna lunch special, because it's awesome. You get a salad included with the meal as well. Between the salad, rolls and lasagna - I never finish the whole meal. For about 7-8 bucks I can have nice lunch and lunch for the next day. 

I have tried a few other things on the menu that are ok, but the lasagna is my favorite.  
The service is normally pretty good also. Overall I think it is a decent restaurant with decent prices.",KSKIrHm03KTEjJM9qPyxPQ,4,"I visit this restaurant often as I work downtown.

DnI776oddqy4V5pW1e7Q1g,5,"I used to eat here all the time in the early 00's, this was my lunch spot when I worked a shit job around the corner & I ALWAYS make a point to visit when I'm passing thru town. Sadly I joined the CG in 2003 & haven't been back as frequently as I'd have liked. I was always holding out hope I'd get stationed nearby. From the B.L.A.T that was always served with perfect & plenty of bacon & avocado to the Cajun chicken sub that had that touch of zest to it everything was always amazing!

I remember the cooler being filled with novelty style sodas of Moxie & Sarsaparillas while the walls were covered in cool signs & newspaper articles about the great things the Plaza Deli was doing! I have so many fond memories about this spot & cannot wait to come back into SB for even a day to grab me something delicious! 

Seriously, I don't think I ever had a bad sandwich from them! I would always order a 2nd sub to throw in a cooler bag when I was leaving town & it would still be in point hours later. This place was my go to spot for so long, I need to come back & say hey to the owner who's name escapes me at the moment, but he always recognized me no matter how long it had been.

I was not disappointed. I took two buddies and they also had a great experience. I ordered a Boba Ice-T for the very first time and relished in the taro and boba balls in my drink. The drinks were a little pricey @ 3.50. The dishes were hot tasty and plentiful for lunch. My friends had a pho dish and another had a Thai curry, both were extremely delicious and very satisfied. They adjust the spice level. The place was well attended but had seating for the lunch crowd as they have inside and outside seating. I would come back and try and another dish at this place. They can make any dish with tofu.",cSyNiFcKLW9_mUXem6A9JQ,4,"Is hard-to-find if you don't look for it. It's in the corner by a tire place. It is well worth it to find this place.
